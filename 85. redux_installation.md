## what is Redux

- redux is a libraray that is good ar state management.
- it stores all the state in a complex object in the top component.
- it can prevent the caos of too many state and data flow.
- it is inspired by database design. 
- it's not designed for only react, but just happened to work well with it.


## why Redux

- when our app gets bigger, we need it to manage the state.
- can share states between two containers.
  - we need a parent component to solve this in react.
- predictible state, sine it follows these principles:
  - single source
  - read only
  - changed by only pure function
  
## what Redux do

- action -> reducer -> store -> make changes, one way data-flow
  - action: button, trigger
  - reducer: pure function
  - store: state

## one sentence to describe Redux

- think of Redux as "this.state"

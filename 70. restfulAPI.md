## what is restful API
- restful: a code style
- more readable (the url should make sense, get("/profile"))
- use http methods in functions, get, post, put, delete
  you can think the methods as a verb, to do the parameter(noun., such as /profile, the profile is a parameter)
  - compatible with different system
  - get: get data
  - post: create data
  - put: edit data
  - delete: remove data
- should be stateless, means every endpoint is independent, can do things by itself,    
and each calls contains enough data to finish the mission.
  - server doesn't need to memorize things
  - input(w/ data) => trigger one endpoint, w/o other help => get output


## get request

### 4 properties come with request object:
- query: ? behind the url address, bind several strings with $
  http://localhost:3000/?name=judy&age=40
  ```
  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.query); // { name: 'judy', age: '40' }
    res.send("get message")
  })
  ```
- body: send with form or json formate

- headers: (not header)
headers data shows in an object
```
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.headers);
    res.send("get message")
})
```
- params: set parameter behind /, and send info on url:
http://localhost:3000/12345
```
app.get('/:id', (req, res) => {
    console.log(req.params);  // { id: '12345' }
    res.send("get message")
})
```
**```params```is default setting, use it and get an object**

### response
- use if/else statement to send responses, ```res.status(400)``` should be inside of ```else { }```
- status: send status(200)(good), status(404)(bad)
```
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  console.log(req.headers);
  res.status(404).send("not found");
})
```

## send static assets 
- add a new folder (public) with an index.html file inside.
- use static method of express to direct to the "folder". (not file)
it will first send index.html back.
if there are css, js file, with <style>, <script> in html, it will send them too.
```
app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/public"))
```

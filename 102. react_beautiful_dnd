# some examples 

## 1. Simple vertical list - https://codesandbox.io/s/k260nyxq9v
(from here: official github: https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/blob/HEAD/docs/about/examples.md)

### 1. structure
- put everything in ```index.js```
- functions, data... out side of App class
- only define ```onDragEnd``` function in App, and is the simplest one. (call reorder function out side of App)

### 1. style
- define style of list and item with 2 functions outside of App
- in that DOM, use inline style to call the functions.

## 2. react-beautiful-dnd tutorial - https://codesandbox.io/s/9z7qwmmr7r

### 2. structure
- context: index.js
- droppable: column.js
- draggable: task.js
- onDragEnd function: more details, since it involves more complicate actions. (3 columns)

### 2. style
- install styled components in each js file
- pass props to styled components

## 3. sb's code on stackoverflow
- https://codesandbox.io/s/react-beautiful-dnd-tutorial-uw8nc?fontsize=14

### 3. structure:
- he doesn't use class, instead he uses function component with hooks.
(seems havn't done)

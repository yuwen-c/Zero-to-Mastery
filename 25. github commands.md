  - git status

  - git commit -m"foo"
  
- ```git push origin branchName```  
  - origin: our fork repo
  - then there is a yellow bar reuest in my github, and in ZTM github, the branchName is there.

- go to ZTM github and send PR request
  - then admin will approve the merge

- we can delete branch after approving.

## before push your change

1. checkout to master, git pull, to get the latest version of master branch.
2. checkout to branch, ``` git merge master```, to combine the new master with branch.
3. if conflict shows, then go editing the file:
  - <<<<< head is where the branch is
  - >>>>> master is what master have
4. git status, to see the modified file
5. git add, git commit, git push

## basic commands using the same github 

```
$ git branch
```
- to see all branches

```
$ git branch (newName)
```
- create a new branch

```
$ git checkout (newBranch)
```
- checkout to that branch

```
$ git pull
```
- update your local files with the repo online

```
$ git status
```
- to check new modified

```
$ git add (fileName)
```
or
```
$ git add .
```
- to add modified files. ("." means all)

```
$ git commit -m"(description)"
```
- to commit modified.
```
git push
```
- to push these modified to the master branch.   


## define local branchs and remote repo

- the first time when doing git push on out local branch, we have to set the connection:

```
$ git push --set-upstream origin (localBranchName)
```
https://ithelp.ithome.com.tw/articles/10140055
(要將本地分支建立起跟遠端儲存庫的對應關係，只要在 git push 的時候加上 --set-upstream 參數，即可將本地分支註冊進 .git\config 設定檔，之後再用 git push 就可以順利的自動推送上去。)

### about upstream

```
$ git push (push to this repo =>)origin (to this branch =>)test
```
- here ```origin``` is the fork in my github, is my version










## extras

- ```sublime .``` open all files in sublime

## put a project up on Github

1. create a new repo
2. get the url with https
3. ``` git clone + url```  clone this folder to local computer
4. copy paste the files to that folder
5. make these files tracked with ```git add .```
6. ```git commit -m"foo foo"```
7. ```git push```

## download a repo from github to local

1. go to the parent folder where you want to put this download repo
2. git clone + url    
(it'll automatically set up upstream)
3. after any change, git add ., git commit, git push.

## commands used in a open source project

- same: 
  - fork
  - git clone
  - git checkout -b branchName   = (create a branck and checkout to it)
  - git status
  - git add .
  - git commit -m"foo"
  
- ```git push origin branchName```  
  - origin: our fork repo
  - then there is a yellow bar request in my github, and in ZTM github, the branchName is there.

- go to ZTM github and send PR request
  - then admin will approve the merge

- we can delete branch after approving.

## before push your change

1. checkout to master, git pull, to get the latest version of master branch.
2. checkout to branch, ``` git merge master```, to combine the new master with branch.
3. if conflict shows, then go editing the file:
  - <<<<< head is where the branch is
  - >>>>> master is what master have
4. git status, to see the modified file
5. git add, git commit, git push

# reference type and primitive type 
## primitive type
- number, string
- null, undefined
- boolean

## reference type: object, created by programmer, not javascript. 
- objects
- array is also object. so array is reference type
- meaning: I assign a file box to an variable => an address.

## weird part:
```
var object1 = { value: 10};
var object2 = object1;           // obj1 and obj2 are point to the same box, whatever in it.
var object3 = { value: 10};
```
- object2 references the address of object1, while object3 create a new space.
```
object1.value = 15;
object2.value;
```
=> 15
```
object3.value;
```
=> 10.
**pass by reference**


# context and scope
## scope is define by a curly bracket { }, function.
- we can get the variable inside function from outside. 
> When it comes to a nested functions, 
> this process of reaching out to find an outside -- global scope variable, called **lexical scoping**.

## context, **this**. find what it is in the left of objective dot.
- in console, console log "this" => window
```js
window === this?
true.
```
- things on the left of dot 
```js
alert("yeahhh")
// same 
window.alert("yeahhh")
// window is the context, the lefty thing of ".".
this.alert("yeahhh")
// here, this is window, is the context.
```
- context is the environment of the object lives, "this", the left part of "."

## a **this** example
```js
const obj1 = {
  fun: function () {console.log(this)}
} 
objA.fun()
// => {fun: ƒ}, this is now the obj1

const obj2 = {
   fun: () => {console.log(this)}
}
obj2.fun()
// => Window {0: global, window: Window, self: Window, document: document, name: "", location: Location, …}
// 如果用arrow function, this 會是執行function的環境
```

**Arrow function cannot be used as an object method.**
```
const objB = {
	a: () => {console.log(this)}
}
objB.a();
```
=> {a: f}
```
const objA = {
	fun: () => { console.log(this)}
};
objA.fun();
```
=>  Window
- It's defined by the lexical environment in which the function was created,
- When using an arrow function syntax in object, ```this``` is the Window.

# class - a new ES6 syntax

## Big words: class/ constructor function/ extends/ super

## class syntax
- parent class
- when a instance gets created, the constructor function gets run, and give the instance some properties
```js
class Player {
  constructor(name, type){
    this.name = name;
    this.type = type;
    console.log("Player", this);   // ```this``` is the created playerA
  }
  methodPlayer(){
    console.log(`Hi, I am ${this.name}, a ${this.type}`);
  }
}

const playerA = new Player("cardiB", "singer");
```

- child class - extends parent one, will have the same thing that parent has.
```js
// parent class
class Player {
  constructor(name, type){
    this.name = name;
    this.type = type;
    console.log("Player", this);   // **1** goes first. ```this``` is baseballPlayer object.
  }
  methodPlayer(){
    console.log(`Hi, I am ${this.name}, a ${this.type}`);
  }
}

// child class
class baseballPlayer extends Player{
  constructor(name, type){
    super(name, type);   // **3: when ```super``` code runs, it calls for the Player class. 
    console.log("baseballPlayer", this); // **2: goes latter. ```this``` is also the baseballPlayer object.    
  }
  methodBaseball(){
    console.log(`I play ${this.type}`);
  }
}
```
## instantiation, create object with new
```
const baseballPlayer1 = new baseballPlayer("Jon", "snow");
const baseballPlayer2 = new baseballPlayer("Sherry", "baseball")
```
## what's happened here?
1. we want to new a instance of baseballPlayer, so the constructor gets run
2. when the super gets called, it will reach out to parent - Player class
3. and then run parent constructor, add two properties.
4. then continues to method of Player
5. then runs method of baseballPlayer.

## this
***1: goes first. ```this``` is baseballPlayer object.    
***2: goes latter. ```this``` is also the baseballPlayer object.     
***3: when super code runs, it calls for the Player class.

- when a single parent class is being instantiated, ```this``` is an object that contains properties of parent class.
- if there are parent class and child class, when the child class is being instantiated, ```this``` in paernt class is also object that made by child class.

## super
- super exists in child component, and must be in the first line in constructor.
```js
constuctor(){
  console.log(this);
  super(name, type)
}
// => cause error!
```
- super contains the same attributes with parent and child attributes.
- when instantiate a child component, super makes the code run through parent class to get those properties.

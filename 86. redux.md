***action -> reducer -> store -> make changes***

## actions.js
- define an action that returns an object, such as setSearchfield, receives a parameter- text.
  - return an object that contains:
  - type: the action that is going to take
  - payload: data send to reducer. 
- export this action
- import { actionName } from constant file
  - replace type name with constant
  
> 2. after input, we need to grab this text, and set state of searchfield
> Description: set searchfield
> 
> import the constant from constants file, using destructuring
> Since it's a multuple export, the way to import it is using { }
> 
> declare an action which receives a parameter,
> and return an object, that includes type, and payload properties.
> TYPE: stands for the describing string/constant,
> PAYLOAD: means the data we'll send to reducer.

### constants.js
- export it.
- set action name as a constant

> 1. a user, type a text in the searchfield, to filter robots    
> Description: change search field  
>    
> The constant and the string(that describes what to do) can be different, but usually do.     

## reducers.js (reduction: 還原、換算)
- import constants.js
- need a initial state declaring in an object.
- a big function, reads actions and spit out state.
- a reducer is a function that has default parameters, and:
  - state=initial state
  - action is an empty { }. action parameter is object that we are returning in action.
- use switch case, the condition is action.type
  - case matchs to our constant, return a state from action (use ```Object.assign```)
  - default


> 3. depends on the text we get, now we can go searching robots.          
> Description: search robots     
> 
> declare a searchRobots reducer, which bears 2 parameters,      
> STATE: stands for the state of searchfield     
> ACTION: means the last step we wrote, it'll return an object that combine type and payload.     
> both parameters come with a default value:     
> STATE: needs a initial state which is empty searchfield     
> ACTION: empty object     
> 
> in the reducer, there are some reactions of certain situations listed.     
> when we receive the action return, the action type meets one situation,     
> we return an object to substitude the original state.     
> 
> to compose this new state object, use ```Object.assign```     
> 3 parameters are:     
> {}- where we going to put the data     
> state- put the initial state inside     
> {searchfield : action.payload}- we'll change the value of searchfield property      


## index.js
- ```import { Provider, connect } from 'react-redux';``` : connect redux to our app
- to create a "store" of redux (from here: action -> reducer -> store -> make changes):
  - ```import { createStore } from 'redux';```
  - ***New a store: use createStore method, and reducer, the function that can return a new state object, to create our store.***
```
// const store = CreateStore(rootReducer);

const store = createStore(searchRobots); // when only have just one reducer(and searchRobots is its name)

ReactDOM.render(  
                <Provider store={store}>  // the props name need to be store, it won't accept other name.
                    <App/>   
                </Provider>, document.getElementById('root'));

```


### try this:
```
// index.js

ReactDOM.render(<App Pstore={store}/>, document.getElementById('root'));
      // pass this store as prop to <App>
      
// App.js

ComponentDidMount(){
  console.log(this.props.Pstore); // {dispatch: ƒ, subscribe: ƒ, getState: ƒ, replaceReducer: ƒ, Symbol(observable): ƒ}
  console.log(this.props.Pstore.getState()); // {searchfield: ""}
}
```
- use ```getState()``` to get our state


### use Provider instead
```
ReactDOM.render(
                <Provider Pstore={store}>
                    <App/>   
                </Provider>, document.getElementById('root'));
```
- we don't want this state intefere all the components, we just want it connecting to App
- so pass the state prop to Provider, and wrap the App


> 4. use the createStore method, with the return new object that reducer gave us, we create a new state.
> then, use provider component to pass this prop


## import { connect } from 'react-redux'; (in App.js)
- to replace the ```subscribe()```
- let container components know the existence of redux store.

> use connect function to let App know: 
> which state change it's going to watch, which action it's interesting
```
// App.js

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(App);
// connect() is a higher order function.  (returns another function, and this function receives App)
```

### outside of App class
> since in index.js, we createStore from reducer-searchRobots,    
> now we pass this state as props (a prop object) to App.   
> this state comes from the return of reducer    
```
const mapStateToProps = (state) =>{
	return {
		searchField: state.searchField
	}
}

```
> dispatch is used for sending actions to reducer.    
> we're going to use this dispatch to let the input change can be passed    
> it'll be passes as a props    
> here the prop onSearchChange is a prop name, and it's also a function.    

```// so we also need to import actions
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
	return{
		onSearchChange: (event) => dispatch(setSearchField(event.target.value))
	}
}
```




## Object.assign()

### a shallow clone
```
const o1 = {a:1, b:2, c:3};
const clone = Object.assign({}, o1) // pass by value
console.log(clone); // {a:1, b:2, c:3}
```

### merge objects
```
const o1 = { a: 1, b: 1, c: 1 };
const o2 = { b: 2, c: 2 };
const o3 = { c: 3 };

const obj = Object.assign({}, o1, o2, o3);
console.log(obj);
// {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
```
- same property will be overwritten

### use this on Reducers.js
```
export const searchRobots = (state=initialState, action={}) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case CHANGE_SEARCH_FIELD:
            // return a new state, not modify it
            // merge several things to the first parameter { }
            return Object.assign({}, state, {searchfield : action.payload});
        default:
            return state;
    }
```


## middleware

-middleware works here:

***action -- MiddleWare --> reducer -> store -> make changes***

- process actions, trigger another functions...

### redux-logger

```
$ npm install redux-logger
```

```
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'; // through this 
import { createLogger} from 'redux-logger';  // user logger

const logger = createLogger(); // create a logger
const store = createStore(searchRobots, applyMiddleware(logger)); // use it as second parameter
```

- you will get this in console: (instead of putting consoles here and there...)
```
action CHANGE_SEARCH_FIELD @ 15:50:14.280
 prev state {searchField: ""}
 action     {type: "CHANGE_SEARCH_FIELD", payload: "l"}
 next state {searchField: "l"}
```
### react-devtools is also recommended

### think in redux way
- in a scale of with thousands of users in your app, all the data flow and interactions..
- if the view is predictable
- how data flows through your app and how you structure your app so that data flows smoothly

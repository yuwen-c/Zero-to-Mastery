# dynamic programming is a technic to store things
- it breaks our task to a collection of subtasks and store it, for next time use

# memoization ... a special form to store cache
- caching is a special way to store values so you can use it later on
- imaging that we store calculation in an object
- when a new parameter passed in, we store the solution
- next time when we encounter the same parameter, we can directly get the value and saving time

=> another time/ space tradeoff

# when should we use dynamic programming?
- a recursion solution, especially in a problem with repetitive subtasks

## why?
- these problems cause a lot of repetition, and the time complexity/ space complexity increasing horriblely, like O(2^N) (O of 2 to the power of N)

## how
- save the result of subtasks like we storing cache

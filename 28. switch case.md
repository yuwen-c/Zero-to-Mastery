## syntax

```
function move(direction){
	var whatHappens = "";
		switch(direction){
    	case "forward":
			  whatHappens = "you enconter a monster!";
			  break;
    	case "back":
			  whatHappens = "you arrived home.";
			  break;
    	case "left":
			  whatHappens = "you run into a troll!";
			  break;
    	case "right":
			  whatHappens = "you found a river.";
			  break;
    	default:
			  whatHappens = "please enter a valid direction.";
    	}
	return whatHappens;
}
```

- break means exit the switch statment.

- can share states between two containers.
  - we need a parent component to solve this in react.
- predictible state, sine it follows these principles:
  - single source
  - read only
  - changed by only pure function

- action -> reducer -> store -> make changes, one way data-flow
  - action: button, trigger
  - reducer: pure function
  - store: state

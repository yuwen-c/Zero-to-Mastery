## what is Redux

- redux is a libraray that is good ar state management.
- it stores all the state in a complex object in the top component.
- it can prevent the caos of too many state and data flow.
- it is inspired by database design. 
- it's not designed for only react, but just happened to work well with it.


## why Redux

- when our app gets bigger, we need it to manage the state.
- can share states between two containers.
  - we need a parent component to solve this in react.
- predictible state, sine it follows these principles:
  - single source
  - read only
  - changed by only pure function
  
## what Redux do

- action -> reducer -> store -> make changes, one way data-flow
  - action: button, trigger
  - reducer: pure function
  - store: state

## one sentence to describe Redux

- think of Redux as "this.state"

## installation of Redux
### use redux on the previous project
- ```git clone + url``` the project
- ```npm install``` to download the needed packages
- ```npm start``` to see if it works well

### installation
- ``` npm install redux```
- ``` npm install react-redux``` to let redux connects to react
  - redux only connects to container, not dumb components.


## start using Redux
- action -> reducer -> store -> make changes

### actions.js
- define an action that returns an object, such as setSearchfield, receives a parameter- text.
  - return an object that contains:
  - type: the action that is going to take
  - payload: data send to reducer. 
- export this action
- import { actionName } from constant file
  - replace type name with constant

### constants.js
- export it.
- set action name as a constant

### reducers.js
- import constants.js
- need a initial state declaring in an object.
- a big function, reads actions and spit out state.
- a reducer is a function that has default parameters, and:
  - state=initial state
  - action is an empty { }. action parameter is object that we are returning in action.
- use switch case, the condition is action.type
  - case matchs to our constant, return a state from action (use ```Object.assign```)
  - default


### index.js
- import { Provider, connect } from 'react-redux' to connect redux to our app
- to create a "store" of redux (from here: action -> reducer -> store -> make changes):
  - import { createStore } from 'redux';
  - new one: 
  ```
  const store = createStore( _____ ); // put our reducer here
  ```
- if we pass this store to <App>:
  - console.log what this store is:
  we can get lots methods here.
  then use getState, we see our searchfield is in there
  so we know this is how redux connects to our app.
  but we don't want this store connects to all our component but just App
  so we got the <Provider> solving this
  use Provide to wrap <App>, and pass store to it, done.



## Object.assign()

### a shallow clone
```
const o1 = {a:1, b:2, c:3};
const clone = Object.assign({}, o1) // pass by value
console.log(clone); // {a:1, b:2, c:3}
```

### merge objects
```
const o1 = { a: 1, b: 1, c: 1 };
const o2 = { b: 2, c: 2 };
const o3 = { c: 3 };

const obj = Object.assign({}, o1, o2, o3);
console.log(obj);
// {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
```
- same property will be overwritten

### use this on Reducers.js
```
export const searchRobots = (state=initialState, action={}) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case CHANGE_SEARCH_FIELD:
            // return a new state, not modify it
            // merge several things to the first parameter { }
            return Object.assign({}, state, {searchfield : action.payload});
        default:
            return state;
    }
```

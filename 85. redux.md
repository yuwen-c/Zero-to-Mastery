## what is Redux

- redux is a libraray that is good ar state management.
- it stores all the state in a complex object in the top component.
- it can prevent the caos of too many state and data flow.
- it is inspired by database design. 
- it's not designed for only react, but just happened to work well with it.


## why Redux

- when our app gets bigger, we need it to manage the state.
- can share states between two containers.
  - we need a parent component to solve this in react.
- predictible state, sine it follows these principles:
  - single source
  - read only
  - changed by only pure function
  
## what Redux do

- action -> reducer -> store -> make changes, one way data-flow
  - action: button, trigger
  - reducer: pure function
  - store: state

## one sentence to describe Redux

- think of Redux as "this.state"

## installation of Redux
### use redux on the previous project
- ```git clone + url``` the project
- ```npm install``` to download the needed packages
- ```npm start``` to see if it works well

### installation
- ``` npm install redux```
- ``` npm install react-redux``` to let redux connects to react
  - redux only connects to container, not dumb components.


# start using Redux
***action -> reducer -> store -> make changes***

## actions.js
- define an action that returns an object, such as setSearchfield, receives a parameter- text.
  - return an object that contains:
  - type: the action that is going to take
  - payload: data send to reducer. 
- export this action
- import { actionName } from constant file
  - replace type name with constant
  
> 2. after input, we need to grab this text, and set state of searchfield
> Description: set searchfield
> 
> import the constant from constants file, using destructuring
> Since it's a multuple export, the way to import it is using { }
> 
> declare an action which receives a parameter,
> and return an object, that includes type, and payload properties.
> TYPE: stands for the describing string/constant,
> PAYLOAD: means the data we'll send to reducer.

### constants.js
- export it.
- set action name as a constant

> 1. a user, type a text in the searchfield, to filter robots    
> Description: change search field  
>    
> The constant and the string(that describes what to do) can be different     

## reducers.js (reduction: 還原、換算)
- import constants.js
- need a initial state declaring in an object.
- a big function, reads actions and spit out state.
- a reducer is a function that has default parameters, and:
  - state=initial state
  - action is an empty { }. action parameter is object that we are returning in action.
- use switch case, the condition is action.type
  - case matchs to our constant, return a state from action (use ```Object.assign```)
  - default


> 3. depends on the text we get, now we can go searching robots.          
> Description: search robots     
> 
> declare a searchRobots reducer, which bears 2 parameters,      
> STATE: stands for the state of searchfield     
> ACTION: means the last step we wrote, it'll return an object that combine type and payload.     
> both parameters come with a default value:     
> STATE: needs a initial state which is empty searchfield     
> ACTION: empty object     
> 
> in the reducer, there are some reactions of certain situations listed.     
> when we receive the action return, the action type meets one situation,     
> we return an object to substitude the original state.     
> 
> to compose this new state object, use ```Object.assign```     
> 3 parameters are:     
> {}- where we going to put the data     
> state- put the initial state inside     
> {searchfield : action.payload}- we'll change the value of searchfield property      


## index.js
- ```import { Provider, connect } from 'react-redux';``` : connect redux to our app
- to create a "store" of redux (from here: action -> reducer -> store -> make changes):
  - ```import { createStore } from 'redux';```
  - ***New a store: use createStore method, and reducer, the function that can return a new state object, to create our store.***
  ```
  const store = createStore(rootReducer); 
  // const store = createStore(searchRobots); // or just put one reducer here for now
  ```
  
### try this:
```
// index.js

ReactDOM.render(<App Pstore={store}/>, document.getElementById('root'));
      // pass this store as prop to <App>
      
// App.js

ComponentDidMount(){
  console.log(this.props.Pstore); // {dispatch: ƒ, subscribe: ƒ, getState: ƒ, replaceReducer: ƒ, Symbol(observable): ƒ}
  console.log(this.props.Pstore.getState()); // {searchfield: ""}
}
```
- use ```getState()``` to get our state


### use Provider instead
```
ReactDOM.render(
                <Provider Pstore={store}>
                    <App/>   
                </Provider>, document.getElementById('root'));
```
- we don't want this state intefere all the components, we just want it connecting to App
- so pass the state prop to Provider, and wrap the App


> 4. use the createStore method, with the return new object that reducer gave us, we create a new state.
> then, use provider component to pass this prop





## Object.assign()

### a shallow clone
```
const o1 = {a:1, b:2, c:3};
const clone = Object.assign({}, o1) // pass by value
console.log(clone); // {a:1, b:2, c:3}
```

### merge objects
```
const o1 = { a: 1, b: 1, c: 1 };
const o2 = { b: 2, c: 2 };
const o3 = { c: 3 };

const obj = Object.assign({}, o1, o2, o3);
console.log(obj);
// {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
```
- same property will be overwritten

### use this on Reducers.js
```
export const searchRobots = (state=initialState, action={}) => {
    switch (action.type) {
        case CHANGE_SEARCH_FIELD:
            // return a new state, not modify it
            // merge several things to the first parameter { }
            return Object.assign({}, state, {searchfield : action.payload});
        default:
            return state;
    }
```

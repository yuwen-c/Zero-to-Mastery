## to display what branch you are in terminal

- download Git Aware Prompt
https://github.com/jimeh/git-aware-prompt
```
$ mkdir ~/.bash
$ cd ~/.bash
$ git clone git://github.com/jimeh/git-aware-prompt.git
```

- add these lines to ```~/.bash_profile``` which I couldn't find,
```
export GITAWAREPROMPT=~/.bash/git-aware-prompt
source "${GITAWAREPROMPT}/main.sh"
```
- so I've created one.

```
Start up Terminal
Type "cd ~/" to go to your home folder
Type "touch .bash_profile" to create your new file.
Edit .bash_profile with your favorite editor (or you can just type "open -e .bash_profile" to open it in TextEdit).
Type ". .bash_profile" to reload .bash_profile and update any functions you add.
```

- if you want more colors, add these lines to the said file.

Mac OS X
```
export PS1="\u@\h \W \[\$txtcyn\]\$git_branch\[\$txtred\]\$git_dirty\[\$txtrst\]\$ "
```
Optionally, if you want a nice pretty prompt when using sudo -s, also add this line:
```
export SUDO_PS1="\[$bakred\]\u@\h\[$txtrst\] \w\$ "
```

## scope

```
const first = () => {
	const greet = "hi!";
	const second = () => {
		alert(greet);
}
return second
}

const newFunc = first();
newFunc();
```

in this function, we create a greet everytime when we execute the function.
because the const is in function scope, it won't colide when the function runs again.

## Closure

- the child scope can access the variable of parent scope.

## Currying

```
const multiply = (a,b) => a * b;
const curryingMultiply = (a) => (b) => a * b;
```

## Composing


## Avoid side effects, purifying functions.

## exercise
```
//#1 Create a one line function that adds adds two parameters

//Closure: What does the last line return?
const addTo = x => y => x + y
var addToTen = addTo(10)
addToTen(3)

//Currying: What does the last line return?
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
const curriedSum = (a) => (b) => a + b
curriedSum(30)(1)


//Currying: What does the last line return?
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
const curriedSum = (a) => (b) => a + b
const add5 = curriedSum(5)
add5(12)

//Composing: What does the last line return?
const compose = (f, g) => (a) => f(g(a));
const add1 = (num) => num + 1;
const add5 = (num) => num + 5;
compose(add1, add5)(10)

//What are the two elements of a pure function?
```

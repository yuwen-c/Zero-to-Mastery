```
const first = () => {
	const greet = "hi!";
	const second = () => {
		alert(greet);
	}
	return second
}

const newFunc = first();
newFunc();
```

## scope
- limit the scope of a variable into a function => local variable.
- avoid interference of functions.

## Closure
- when the engine runs to line 10, it calls first function.  
Within this function, the second function gets called, then return second function.   
- It turns out that:
```
const newFunc = alert(greet);
```
  - although that greet seems to jump out the scope of function first, it will remeber. => that's called CLOSURE
- child scope can remeber the parent scope, but not on the opposite.

## Currying

```
const multiply = (a,b) => a * b;
const curryingMultiply = (a) => (b) => a * b;
```
```
curryingMultiply(3)(4);
```
=> 12
- more extensible, see this:
```
const multiplyBy5 = curryingMultiply(5);
```
```
multiplyBy5(4);
```
=> 20

## Composing
```
const compose = (f,g) => (a) => f(g(a));
const sum = (num) => num+1;
compose(sum, sum)(5);
```
=> 7

## Avoid side effects, purifying functions.

## exercise
```
//#1 Create a one line function that adds adds two parameters

//Closure: What does the last line return?
const addTo = x => y => x + y
var addToTen = addTo(10)
addToTen(3)

//Currying: What does the last line return?
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
const curriedSum = (a) => (b) => a + b
curriedSum(30)(1)


//Currying: What does the last line return?
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
const curriedSum = (a) => (b) => a + b
const add5 = curriedSum(5)
add5(12)

//Composing: What does the last line return?
const compose = (f, g) => (a) => f(g(a));
const add1 = (num) => num + 1;
const add5 = (num) => num + 5;
compose(add1, add5)(10)

//What are the two elements of a pure function?
```

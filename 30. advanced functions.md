```
const first = () => {
	const greet = "hi!";
	const second = () => {
		alert(greet);
	}
	return second
}

const newFunc = first();
newFunc();
```

## scope
- limit the scope of a variable into a function => local variable.
- avoid interference of functions.

## Closure
- when the engine runs to line 10, it calls first function.  
Within this function, the second function gets called, then return second function.   
- It turns out that:
	```
	const newFunc = alert(greet);
	```
  - although that greet seems to jump out the scope of function first, it will remeber. => that's called CLOSURE
- child scope can remeber the parent scope, but not on the opposite.

## Currying
- currying is make a multiple parameter function to accept one parameter at a time

```
const multiply = (a,b) => a * b;
const curryingMultiply = (a) => (b) => a * b;

curryingMultiply(3)(4);
```
- imagine that, that function first receives a, so
```
curryingMultiply = (3) => (b) => 3*b
```
- then it receives b, so function = 12


- 一個需要兩個參數的function，把他拆開為，一次只傳入一個參數，且回傳另一個function的組合式function。
```js
const add = (p,q) => {
    return p+q
}

const curriedAdd = (p) => {
    return (q) => {
        return p+q
    }
}
const add5 = curriedAdd(5)
console.log(add5(100))
```

- 這個組合式function可以拆開，寫為：
```
subFunction = topFunction(p) -> 得到一個function
```
- 然後呼叫subFunction(q)即可得到值。

### Currying - it can be used like this:
```
const multiply = (a,b) => a * b;
const curryingMultiply = (a) => (b) => a * b; // 把括號都省略的寫法
const multiplyBy5 = curryingMultiply(5);
// these 3 lines can deine a new function - multiplyBy5, and then we can use it.

multiplyBy5(40); //200
```

## Compose
- COMPOSE is : put 2 functions togeter to make a composed function,     
while a return(OUTPUT) of one function is the parameter(INPUT) of another function.
```
const compose = (f,g) => (a) => f(g(a));
const sum = (num) => num+1;
compose(sum, sum)(5); //7
```
- the above function compose, receives f and g parameters, returns a function that requires parameter a, and return another funciton.
- let's see, when we have a = 5 => ```g(5)``` 
  - since we define g is sum function => ```sum(5)``` => 6
  - now f is also sum function => ```sum(6)``` => 7

## Avoid side effects, purifying functions.
- side effects:
  - console.log
  - change some varible...

- Do return things, that helps to keep deterministic.

## exercise
```
//#1 Create a one line function that adds adds two parameters

//Closure: What does the last line return?
const addTo = x => y => x + y
var addToTen = addTo(10)
addToTen(3)

//Currying: What does the last line return?
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
const curriedSum = (a) => (b) => a + b
curriedSum(30)(1)


//Currying: What does the last line return?
const sum = (a, b) => a + b
const curriedSum = (a) => (b) => a + b
const add5 = curriedSum(5)
add5(12)

//Composing: What does the last line return?
const compose = (f, g) => (a) => f(g(a));
const add1 = (num) => num + 1;
const add5 = (num) => num + 5;
compose(add1, add5)(10)

//What are the two elements of a pure function?
```

# on github repo, there are warnings, how can we fix that?

## update a project
- clone the repo in Github and do:
```
$ npm install
```
- open the file and focus on package.json
- test if it's working
```
$ npm start
```
=> errors
- to fix errors, do:
```
$ npm audit fix
```
=> errors, breaking changes
=> need to check that one by one
```
$ npm audit
```
=> shows a list of issues


## package.json
**the easiest way to update a project is to update the package.json**
- react.script is outdated
```
$ npm update

// and see the version change in package.json
^16.2.0 -> ^16.10.2
```
=> it will update with minor release change of your package. 
=> but still got some vulnerability

- then look through all the changes BEFORE USING THE FORCE COMMAND
```
$ npm audit fix --force
```
=> it will update to the highest version, and may break your app.

- check again 
```
$ npm audit
```
=> 0 vulnerability

- run again to ensure the project still works.
```
$ npm start
```
=> works fine and no console error.


## push to Github

- after pushing, no more security warning
(commit -m "fixing security issues and updating libraries")


## upgrade react of you project
- npm update will only update the minor release depend on ```^```, to upgrade a new version, use npm install
```
$ npm install react@latest react-dom@latest
```
- react and react-dom have to install together
- or you can choose a specific version
```
$ npm install react@17.0.0 react-dom@17.0.0
```

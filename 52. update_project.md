## update a project
- clone the repo in Github
- open the file and focus on package.json
- test if it's working
```
$ npm install
```
=> errors

```
$ npm audit fix
```
=> errors, breaking changes
=> need to check that one by one

```
$ npm audit
```
=> shows a list of issues


## package.json

- react.script is outdated
```
$ npm update
```
=> go to the file and click on the react part, the version of minor release changes.
=> but still got some vulnerability

- then look through all the changes.
```
$ npm audit fix --force
```
- check again 
```
$ npm audit
```
=> 0 vulnerability


- go to react website to see the latest version of react,   
change the ```^16.10.2``` to ```^17.0.0```, and run again:
```
$ npm install
```

- run again to ensure the project still works.
```
$ npm start
```
=> works fine and no console error.

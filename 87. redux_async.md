## use redux in asynchronous process - redux-thunk middleware
- a simple way to deal with asynchronous function: Redux-thunk
```
$ npm install redux-thunk
```

- use it via applyMiddleware.
```
applyMiddleware(thunk, logger)  // by this order
```

## constants.js
- create constantes for this promise, there are 3 types.
- pending, success, failed.

## actions.js
- another function to deal with load robot in componentDidMount 
- use dispatch to transmite, ship the action.
- this action not returns an obj, but another function
- 3 types.
```
do fetch here
```

## reducers.js
- same, use switch case to list 3 posibilities, and 1 default.
- we'll need a new initial state which refers to robots.
- same, return different state of each case.
```
switch case here
```

## index.js
- same, import the new reducer we have
- now we have 2 reducers, how can we use them at the same time? => ``` import { combineReducers?? } from 'redux';```
```
const store = combineReducers( 2 reducers)???/ root
```


## App.js

- first we need to change our mapStateToProps, since we had only one state before, now we have to assign which state.
```
state.searchRobots.searchField.
```
- re write mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps.....LOL...........

- finally, we don't need constructor anymore, and change componentDidMount to this.props...., since now robots is send as a prop.


## How MiddleWare Redux-Thunk gonna work
- Thunk waits and see if an action doesn't return an obj, but a function, then send a dispatch to it.
- first it send a dispatch with pending to reducer, saying that: i'll let you know when this promise get return.

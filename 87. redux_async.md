## use redux in asynchronous process - redux-thunk middleware
- a simple way to deal with asynchronous function: Redux-thunk
```
$ npm install redux-thunk
```

- use it via applyMiddleware.
```
import thunkMiddleware from 'redux-thunk';

const store = createStore(searchRobots, applyMiddleware(thunkMiddleware, logger));
  // by this order
```

## constants.js
- create constantes for this promise, there are 3 types.
- pending, success, failed.

## actions.js
- another function to deal with load robot in componentDidMount 
- use dispatch to transmite, ship the action.
- this action not returns an obj, but another function (so we'll use thunk here)
- 3 types.

```
export const fetchRobots = (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({type: REQUEST_ROBOTS_PENDING});    // dispatch the pending promise
    fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')   // do fetch
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(robots => dispatch({type: REQUEST_ROBOTS_SUCCESS, payload: robots}))  // when retuning data, payload
    .catch(error => dispatch({type: REQUEST_ROBOTS_FAILED, payload:error}))    // otherwise, error
}
```

## reducers.js
- use switch case to list 3 posibilities, and 1 default.
- we'll need a new initial state which refers to robots.
- same, return different state of each case.

```
const robotsInitialState = {
    isPending: false,   // default should be false
    robots: [],
    error: ''    
}
export const loadRobots = (state=robotsInitialState, action={}) => {
    switch(action.type){
        case REQUEST_ROBOTS_PENDING:
            return Object.assign({}, state, { isPending: true })
        case REQUEST_ROBOTS_SUCCESS:
            return Object.assign({}, state, { robots: action.payload.robots, isPending: true})
        case REQUEST_ROBOTS_FAILED:
            return Object.assign({}, state, { error: action.payload.error, isPending: false })
        default:
            return state;
    }
}
```

## index.js
- now, we have 2 reducers, so:
  - 1. import the new reducer
  - 2. use a method called ```import { combineReducers } from 'redux'; ```
  - 3. use this method to create a root reducer ``` const rootReducer = combineReducers(reducer 1, reducer 2);```
  - 4. use this on createStore ``` const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunkMiddleware, logger)); ```



## App.js

- first we need to change our mapStateToProps, since we had only one state before, now we have to assign which state.
```
state.searchRobots.searchField
```
- re write mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps.....LOL...........
```
const mapStateToProps = (state) =>{
	return {
		searchField: state.searchRobots.searchField, 
		robots: state.loadRobots.robots,
		isPending: state.loadRobots.robots,
		error: state.loadRobots.error
	}
}
```
```
// this function will receive dispatch: trigger the action(the obj we've created)
// and we use dispatch to send action to reducer
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
	return{ // return an obj:  a prop that App will receive
		// a function that replace onSearchChange to update searchfield state
		// receive an event, dispatch the action to reducer. this action listens to the changes
		onSearchChange: (event) => dispatch(setSearchField(event.target.value)),
		// a function that replace componentDidMount to load robots
		// the action - fetchRobots not returns an obj, but a function with a dispatch method
		onRequestRobots: () => fetchRobots(dispatch)
		// can be also write like this:
		// onRequestRobots: () => dispatch(fetchRobots()) 
	}
}
```

- finally, we don't need constructor anymore, and change componentDidMount to this.props...., since now robots is send as a prop.


## How MiddleWare Redux-Thunk gonna work
- Thunk waits and see if an action doesn't return an obj, but a function, then send a dispatch to it.
- first it send a dispatch with pending to reducer, saying that: i'll let you know when this promise get return.

# Main purpose
- used to build a static website

# static? dynamic?
- React, and next.js are dynamic websites
- dynamic website: when a user send a request, then the html file is produced.
- React: client side render, html file render on the browser.
- Next.js: server side render, files got rendered on server, for huge website, complex logic, runs fast.

- Gatsby: HTML files are generated on "building step", way ahead before receving a client request.
- better for a blog that the view doesn't change a lot.

# "global" state:
- to set a global state and get it from any level in app.
- Using context, we can avoid passing props through intermediate elements:
- a global situation such as: current user, theme, preferred language.
- only use context when the state is needed in many components.

# trade off
- it makes component difficult to reuse.
- If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context.

## createContext()

```
const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);
```
- defaultvalue can be empty


## Context.Provider
```
<MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>
```
- when the provider value changes, all descendants re-render.

## Context.Consumer -> functional component
- Requires a function as a child
```
<MyContext.Consumer>
  {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
</MyContext.Consumer>
```
- the "value" argument equals to the props of nearest provider
- if there is no provider, then "value" is the defaultValue of createContext.

# algorithm, is simply functions.
- Data structures + Algorithm = Programs

# Recurtion. is not technically an algorithm. more like a concept
- a function which is defined in terms of itself.
- ```ls -R```, list all files in a folder, and if there is a folder in it, go there and unfold it... "keep going on and on"
- think of you are doing a subtask repeatedly


## stackoverflow: "maximum call stack size exceeded"
- think of a function that calls itself, and that causes "stack overflow"
- happens when we are running out of memory, those memory are taken to memorize the stacks...
- everytime a function got called, create a stack

## the inconvenience of recursion
- recursion: it takes memory to remember things, may cause a stack overflow when we run out of memory, it won't stop by itself

## stop point, base case
- to stop a recursion function, we need this. 
- return here, to stops a function
- 

## know more about recursion
- 寫在recursion重複執行以後的code，不會被執行
- 隨著function一次次被呼叫，stack的數量不斷在累積，當達到了base case時，function stops by return.
- 接著，開始依序從上到下執行stack ....所以，很重要的是，如果這時，這些stack本身沒有回傳結果，那最後function就會是undefined
- you have to return what you need!
- 所以，通常recursion裡面會有兩個return, on for base case, one for recursion itself.

## 3 Rules of recursion

1. find subtasks (recursive pattern)
2. set stop point, or base case
3. return your value. usually in recursive, there are 2 returns

## conclusion - tradeoff
- 所有recursion都可以用loop做出來，重點是怎麼選擇？
- 好處：Recursion寫法make you code dry, and sometimes more readable.
- 壞處：depends on the question, may takes a O(2^N) time complexity, on the contrary, a for loop iteration only takes  an O(N).

- So why are we learning this? Sometimes it’s hard to solving some typical questions with for loop, especially **traverse a tree**…

### An extra, some languages have system to prevent the time complexity issue and ES6 also has this. So recursion is workable in real world.

### What recursion problem we may encounter in real world?

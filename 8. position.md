## static

- default.  
- the element cannot be moved.

## relative

- relative to it's original position. 
- left/right/top/bottom/z-index will work
  
## absolute

- the element is removed from the flow of the document 
- interaction between parent and child:
  - child-absolute: the position is based on the window
  - child-absolute, parent-relative: the position is based on the parent.

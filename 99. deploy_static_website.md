## cheat heroku by add dynamic file

- heroku serves dynamic website only
- cheat it by adding php file.


## first try
- https://gist.github.com/wh1tney/2ad13aa5fbdd83f6a489
```
Steps
Add a file called composer.json to the root directory by running touch composer.json
Add a file called index.php to the root directory by running touch index.php
Rename the homepage (e.g. index.html) to home.html
In index.php, add the following line: <?php include_once("home.html"); ?>
In composer.json, add the following line: {}
Run git push heroku master
```
- keeps telling me: npm ERR! missing script: start
- I thought the problem was on my package.json, and kept finding scripts, some said that use start: node.js but I don't have one.
- then I went to heroku dash board and found there is a "web npm start"!
- I think it's probably because I push to heroku then add php file, so heroku had the npm start setting.

### fix
- delete the whole heroku app
- go through these steps again.
- but this time I use another setting. (second try)


## second try
- https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/deploy-static-site-heroku
- in terminal, sign in heroku, go to directory of project
- add ```index.php```, and ```<?php header( 'Location: /index.html' ) ;  ?>```
- I chenge the home.html back to index.html 
- (however I didn't delete the composer.json)
- git add, commit, 
- heroku create (project name)
- then it works. LOL

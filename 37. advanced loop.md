## basic: for, forEach

```
const basket = ["ball", "apple", "pencil", "money"];
```
- forEach syntax is more clear than for.

```
basket.forEach(item => console.log(item));
```

## for of

```
for (item of basket){
  console.log(item);
}
```
=> 
ball
apple
pencil
money

```
for (item of "basket"){
  console.log(item);
}
```
=>
b
a
s
k
e
t

- ITERATING, iterable: array and string


## for in

- work with object
- ENUMERATING

```
const detailedBasket = {
	"apple": 5,
	"orange": 10,
	"grape": 1000
}
```

```
for (item in detailedBasket){
	console.log(item);
}
```
=>
apple
orange
grape



## so, ```for of``` goes with array, while ```for in``` goes with object

- what if we chaellenge it?
```
for (item of detailedBasket){
	console.log(item);
}
```

- No, we cannot do ```for of``` with an obj.

```
for (item in basket){
	console.log(item);
}
```

- Yes, we when ```for in``` runs with an array, it pretends that the array is an "obj" and get it's property, which is the index of an array.

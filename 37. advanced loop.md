# about for/while, for/ forEach... loops, see [115. codingChallenge.md](https://github.com/yuwen-c/Zero-to-Mastery/blob/master/115.%20codingChallenge.md)


## for vs. for/in vs. for/of vs. while vs. do/while

for - loops through a block of code a number of times          
for/in - loops through the **properties** of an object          
for/of - loops through the **values** of an iterable object          
while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true          
do/while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop while a specified condition is true 


## for/of, for/in conclusion

- ```for of``` does Not work with object because it's not iterating.
  - ITERATING, iterable: array and string

- ```for in``` loops over the enumerable property names of an obj.
  - array, string, object.
  
- Instead, we can also use these methods ```Object.keys()```, ```Object.values()```, ```Object.entries()```. (see 35. ES8(ES2017))






---------------------

====== old version =====


## basic: ```for```, ```forEach```

```
const basket = ["ball", "apple", "pencil", "money"];
```
- forEach syntax is more clear than for.

```
basket.forEach(item => console.log(item));
```

## for of
- array
```
for (item of basket){
  console.log(item);
}
```
=> 
ball
apple
pencil
money

- string
```
for (item of "basket"){
  console.log(item);
}
```
=>
b
a
s
k
e
t

- ITERATING, iterable: array and string


## for in
- the variable inside is index
- work with object or array
- ENUMERATING

```
const detailedBasket = {
	"apple": 5,
	"orange": 10,
	"grape": 1000
}
```

```
for (index in detailedBasket){
	console.log(index);
}
```
=>    
apple    
orange    
grape    
```
for (index in detailedBasket){
	console.log(detailedBasket[index]);
}
```
=>    
5    
10    
1000    

**so, ```for (item of array) ``` goes with array,**\
**while ```for (index in array/ object)``` goes with array and object.**\
**because array is object in JS

- what if we challenge it?
```
for (item of detailedBasket){
	console.log(item);
}
```
> Uncaught TypeError: detailedBasket is not iterable
    at <anonymous>:1:14

- No, we cannot do ```for of``` with an obj.

```
for (item in basket){
	console.log(item);
}
```
=>

- Yes, when```for in``` runs with an array, it pretends that the array is an "obj" and get it's property, which is the index of an array.

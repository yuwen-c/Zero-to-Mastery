# play around with linked list
- https://visualgo.net/en/list
- a node: value + pointer, 
- head, tail

## differences between linked list and array
- add element from head or from tail, are O(1),  <--> array, add to the beginning is O(n)
- linked list is scattered data structure, the addresses are randomly distributed. <--> array is one by one.
- we cannot directly point to a certain index, always traverse from head and count, so lookup is O(n). <--> lookup of array is O(1)

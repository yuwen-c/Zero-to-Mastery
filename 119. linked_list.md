# play around with linked list
- https://visualgo.net/en/list
- a node: value + pointer, 
- head, tail

## differences between linked list and array
- add element from head or from tail, are O(1),  <--> array, add to the beginning is O(n)
- linked list is scattered data structure, the addresses are randomly distributed. <--> array is one by one.
- we cannot directly point to a certain index, always traverse from head and count, so lookup is O(n). <--> lookup of array is O(1)


## pointer
- pointer is areference which points to a node, a object, another address.
```
let obj1 = {a: true};
let obj2 = obj1;
```
- now obj2 is pointing to obj1, is "referencing" it.
- even if obj1 is disappear, if the referencing exists, then obj2 can still get the obj1's value.
- then if we modify ```obj2 = 'hello'```, now the referencing is gone, so the memory space, without any referencing, will be recycled.
- languages like Javascript, has garbage collected, can automatically recycling, but other low-level language cannot.

# review: collsion in hash table
- in hash table, there is an issue called collision
- it means 2 or more keys are hashed to the same address and these 2 pairs are store in it, one after another, like a linear structure.
- this structure is "linked list".

# play around with linked list
- https://visualgo.net/en/list
- linked list is made of : nodes, a node: value + pointer.
- head: the first node, tail: the last tail
- the pointer of last tail points to ```null```.

## differences between linked list and array - No prebuilt index
- add element from head or from tail, are O(1),  <--> array, add to the beginning is O(n)
- linked list is scattered data structure, the addresses are randomly distributed. <--> array is one by one.
- we cannot directly point to a certain index, always traverse from head and count, so lookup is O(n). <--> lookup of array is O(1)


## pointer, references, memory recycling
- pointer is areference which points to a node, an object, another address.
```
let obj1 = {a: true};
let obj2 = obj1;
```
- now obj2 is pointing to obj1, is "referencing" it.
- even if obj1 disappeared, if the referencing exists, then obj2 can still get the obj1's value.
- then if we modify ```obj2 = 'hello'```, now the referencing is gone, so the memory space, without any referencing, will be recycled.
- languages like Javascript, has ```garbage collected```, can automatically recycling, but other low-level language cannot.


# implement of linked list which does not exist in Javascript
- implement a class of linked list with methods: append, prepend, insert, remove
- also implement a class of node
- now we know why append and prepend are O(1)
- and why insert and remove are O(n), since it has to traverse before doing the method. the traverse method can be made independently.


# single and double linked list

- go through the project

## front end
- components, layout.
- add functionality(button, input. onChange, onClick)
- connect API (face-recognition)

## routing
- a plan for signIn, signOut: where should it go? what navigation should be put on the screen?
- add a route function with page parameter to direct to that page.
***an arrow function in child component is needed***
- use setState to store input information 
- trigger parent setState in child component: call a parent function

## server end
***run ```npm init``` to get ```package.json```***
***install nodemon to monitor changes and run it automatically.*** (```--save-dev``` and ```"start" : "nodemon script.js"```)
***install express to build a server***

- a plan. what route, what method, bear what data, in head or body, url, response?
- base on the plan, write routes.
- test them with postman
- a fake database is needed. think of a table as an array, every row of data is an object.
- think what data you need to store, in what knid of type.
***on server end, console.log will be in terminal of server***
```
const database = {
    users:[
        {
            id: 123,
            name: "Judy",
            email: "judy@gmail.com",
            password: "123",
            entries: 0,
            joined: new Date()
        },
        {
            id: 124,
            name: "David",
            email: "david@gmail.com",
            password: "124",
            entries: 0,

            password: ""
        }
    ]
}
```
## connect server end to front end
***install cors (伺服器端存取控制) to allow to connect front end to server with HTTP***
- run one on port 3000 and the other on 3001
- test it with ```componentDidMount``` and ```fetch``` to see if they are connected


## database
***install knex to connect postgresql with server***
***install bcrypt-nodejs, or latest version bcrypt, to encrypt password***

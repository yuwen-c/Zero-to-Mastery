# Main purpose
- used to build a static website

# static? dynamic?
## dynamic
- React(create-react-app), and next.js are dynamic websites
- dynamic website: when a user send a request, then the html file is produced.
- create-react-app: client side render, html file render on the browser.
- Next.js: server side render, files got rendered on server, for huge website, complex logic, runs fast.

## static
- Gatsby: HTML files are generated on "building step", way ahead before receving a client request.
- better for a blog that the view doesn't change a lot, the contents are predetermined.

(but it also said that the context are dynamically generated inside of gastby?)

## netlify: provide a continuous deployment platform

## gatsby cli - command line. Installation.
```
$ npx gatsby new gatsby-blog(project name)
```
**```npx``` is a new feature comes with ```npm``` which allows us using a package w/o installing it globally on computer.

## navagate 4 files 
- ```gatsby-config.js```: main region. ```siteMetaData``` combine graphQL
- ```gatsby-browser.js```
- ```gatsby-ssr```: you can also set it to server side render here
- ```gatsby-node```

## ```package.json``` scripts
- run the website (SERVE our site ON LOCALHOST)
```
$ npm run develop 
```
- localhost:8000/: website
- localhost:8000/___graphql: for graphql

## the gatsby WAY
- gatsby has "build-in" functions and if you need it, use it's way of setting things.
- REDEFINE my concept of "liberty". How "liberal" a framework is actually is relative.
- as of an create-react-app, you have to put pluggings together by you own to get functions you need.

## caveat of gatsby
- since the html files are decided at building step, we have to write the layout things(header, footer) on every single page.

## use graphiql to get your query
- we can get all files through allFile, and get nodes which represent the files.

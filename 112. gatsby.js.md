# What problem does Gatsby solve? - routing  
# UNDERSTAND what is Gatsby

## How did we deal with routing with traditional HTML files?
- a ```index.html``` representing "root". when server receives a request, sends back the index.html as default.
- in the same folder, we have different pages, like page-2.html, page-3.html
- To link to them, add this in ```index.html```: ```<a href="page-2.html">link to page-2</a>```
- ```slug``` will show show behind of the URL, slug name is the page name.
- [see demo](https://dreamy-gates-80ef34.netlify.app/)


## in create-react-app, there is no "slug" => low SEO
- in a create-react-app, we controll route in a different way, without showing slug on URL, this means it's hard to find your page with google searching.
- to solve this, use ```react-route```

## Gatsby comes with build-in ```react-route```

### a panoramic of gatsby files
![gatsby-files](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51497994/117394179-3eacd980-af28-11eb-867a-f6d47be72d6a.png)
#### the first layer: will use: ```gatsby-config.js```, ```gatsby-node.js```, ```package.json```
#### ```src folder```:
![src_pages](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51497994/117394761-4c169380-af29-11eb-9a96-827c633dc9bc.png)
- ```components```: header, layout,
- ```images```: image files
- ```markdown-pages```: blog-posts, we will explain it later.
- ```pages```: ```index.js```, ```404,js``` and some page.js files 
- ```templates```
1. pages folder deals route for us with build-in ```react-route```\

- in index.js, the default home page, set link to page-2:
```react
<Layout>

  <Link to="/page-2/">go to page 2</Link>
</Layout>
```
- in ```pages``` folder, routing is like the traditional HTML's way.
- it's a manual-routing (we'll explain that)

#### small test, add a ```a``` folder and connect to the folder
- add a ```a``` folder with a page-3 in it. connect to the folder
- change page-3 to index.html, connect to a folder then immediately show page-3(index.html)
![a_folder_index](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51497994/118383304-3bec6b80-b62f-11eb-9d56-2f3da42e28db.png)
- connect to a folder by adding ```/a``` as a slug, then the inde.html will pop up directly.
- 這是他的react-route自動設定。當跟伺服器要一個folder時，伺服器會直接顯示裡面的index頁面。

## let's talk about ```Markdown``` for a second
- why use markdown? easy to get an article with basical format.
- but the markdown files don't fit fot ```pages``` folder, we need more tools.

### to solve routing of markdown - ```gatsby-node.js```
- here we define:
1. where do we put markdown files? which folder?
2. which template should be applied to markdown?
3. 產生route (slug) of every pages => 連到什麼網址，就會出現哪個page的內容 => 把route name 跟網頁內容連在一起。
- this is a auto-routing

### auto-routing and manual-routing
- manual-routing, everytime you add a new page, set a route. 
- auto-routing, do some settings and then, you can apply it to 100 pages.

## GraphQL - the yellow page of files
- why shouldn't we import the image directly? why graphQL?
1. 可一次篩選一批檔案，不用一個一個處理。
2. 設定好後，以後同類型的檔案也會自動匯入，不用再改。
3. 可將篩選到的檔案排序、做處理。
- Not only the inner files, GraphQL can also receives files from outside. (CMS, client management system, like contentful)
- Configuration: ```Gatsby-config.js```

# Main purpose
- used to build a static website

# static website? dynamic website?
## dynamic
- React(create-react-app), and next.js are dynamic websites
- dynamic website: when a user send a request, then the html file is produced.
- create-react-app: client side render, html file render on the browser.
- Next.js: server side render, files got rendered on server, for huge website, complex logic, runs fast.

## static
- Gatsby: HTML files are generated on "building step", way ahead before receving a client request.
- better for a blog that the view doesn't change a lot, the contents are predetermined.

(but it also said that the context are dynamically generated inside of gastby?)

## netlify: provide a continuous deployment platform

## gatsby cli - command line. Installation.
```
$ npx gatsby new gatsby-blog(project name)
```
**```npx``` is a new feature comes with ```npm``` which allows us using a package w/o installing it globally on computer.
- if you forgot to use npx, the gatsby will install globally, and showing some warning.
- uninstall command:
```
$ npm uninstall -g gatsby-cli
```
-----
- since I didn't globally install gatsby-cli, so now when I apply any gatsby command, add ```npx``` in front of it.
- for example, to clean caches
```
$ npx gatsby clean
```

## navagate 4 files 
- ```gatsby-config.js```: main region. ```siteMetaData``` combine graphQL. (**set your blog name here**) packages you what to use.
- ```gatsby-browser.js```
- ```gatsby-ssr.js```: you can also set it to server side render here
- ```gatsby-node.js```: set nodes here. nodes: each file

## ```package.json``` scripts
- run the website (SERVE our site ON LOCALHOST)
```
$ npm run develop 
```
- localhost:8000/: website
- localhost:8000/___graphql: for graphql

## the gatsby WAY
- gatsby has "build-in" functions and if you need it, use it's way of setting things.
- REDEFINE my concept of "liberty". How "liberal" a framework is actually is relative.
- as of an create-react-app, you have to put pluggings together by you own to get functions you need.

## caveat of gatsby
- since the html files are decided at building step, we have to write the layout things(header, footer) on every single page.

## use graphiql to get your query
- we can get all files through allFile, and get nodes which represent the files.

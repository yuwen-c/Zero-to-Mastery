## getting start
- https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/getting-started/introduction/
- install
```
$ npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

- add css file to index.js or  app.js. 
  I put it in index.js, and the order should be like this:
```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';           // here, above then other css file
// Put any other imports below so that CSS from your
// components takes precedence over default styles.
import './index.css';
import App from './container/App/App';
import 'tachyons';
```

- copy component you want to a new file in react app.   
  the name of the function should be different to the bootstrap components' name.
  
- importing components, after copying the template, just follow the error message to see what are you missing 
```
import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';
```
- then it should work.

## bootstrap bear some css that may effect your file.
- use selector tool of chrome, you can find where the css settings come from with click ```<style>``` in the right
  - user agent stylesheet comes from browser

- if you don't want such as font size to be changed, add a css styling on it to overwrite bootstrap setting
- 


## navbar dropdown - collapseOnSelect (點按選項後收回導覽列)
- if your purpose functionality doesn't work:
  - read documentation, althrough react-bootstrap doesn't do it well, but the table below has information
  - grab a template in a seperate react app and test it, and take a little piece away, to see if it still work.
  - after finding out what's the essential part, then modify your original app.

- in this case, I want collapseOnSelect, already found the key word on documentation table
- add it to my app, doesn't
- make an isolate app with the example template (which works), and find out if I take the ```href``` away, this function doesn't work.
- add ```href``` back to my app, which cause another problem, the app refresh to another page when routing.
  - an empty ```herf``` doesn't work, the ```href``` don't even exist
  ```
  href = ""
  ```
  - an space string works, however it turns out that app cannot recognize it, so other functionality is effected.    
    (next time when you enter the nav menu, all items are marked, since to our app, a " " item has been chosen)
  ```
  href = " "
  ```
  - so use different names to fix it.
  ```
  href = "home"
  ```

### fix direct to other page when routing - ```herf``` & ```event.preventDefault()```
- official react 
https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html  
```
function ActionLink() {
  function handleClick(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('The link was clicked.');
  }

  return (
    <a href="#" onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </a>
  );
}
```
- add ```href``` still has some issues:
  - change url: http://localhost:3001/home
  - directing to other page, user can see a "flash" of page

- to fix the directing, you can just add ```#```:
  - but still has a changed url: http://localhost:3001/#home
```
<NavDropdown.Item 
    href="#howItWorks"  // add a # here
    onClick={() => {onRouteChange('howItWorks')}}               
  >How it works</NavDropdown.Item>
```

- another way is using ```event.preventDefault()```
  - in ```onClick```, beside of our original function, also trigger ```event.preventDefault()``` to prevent a url change and a page refreshment.
  - the ```event``` is parameter of onClick
```
<NavDropdown.Item 
  href="calculation" 
  onClick={(event) => {onRouteChange('calculation'); event.preventDefault()}}
  // onClick={() => {onRouteChange('calculation')}}    // original function
>Calculation</NavDropdown.Item>
```
### fix the bg-blue of chose menu 
- since our routing is controled by other function, not only by ```href```,   
the blue bg-color of chosen item when you opening menu next time is confusing.
- remove this css: just add a css file to overwrite it, set it like the none-active one.
```
.dropdown-item.active, .dropdown-item:active {
    color: #212529;
    text-decoration: none;
    background-color: transparent;
}
```

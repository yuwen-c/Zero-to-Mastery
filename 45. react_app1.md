## delete files that you won't use in src folder
- app
- logo
- only remain the index and serviceworker.

## build component

- the component we're going to use is card.
- index.js:
  - render ```<div><Card/></div>```
  - import
- card.js:
  - import React
  - build function Card and make JSX in card.
  - export default Card.
  - add css(ttachyons).
  
## use list of robots
- paste the list file in index, and import.
  - if it's a default export, then use the normal import.
  - a multi export goes with destructuring, ```import {Component} from ```...

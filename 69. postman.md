## postman

- let you test the server before connect to the front end.
- mimic an user send request to the server with get, post... different ways.
since with a browser we can only use get method easily.

### request methods
- get

- post
  - select body data type:
  form: x-www-form-urlencoded
  JSON: raw, and pick json
- put

- delete

### middleware - body parser

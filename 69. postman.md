## postman

- let you test the server before connect to the front end.
- mimic an user send request to the server with get, post... different ways.
since with a browser we can only test get method easily.

### request methods
- get
***get 不能有body，要傳的資料會放在網址。 (有放body會出現syntax error)***     
***body-parser用在post和put, 跟get, delete無關***     

- post
  - select body data type:     
  form: form-data, x-www-form-urlencoded    =>  sending forms through HTML.    
***to "unlock" this, we need the body-parser, or express-build-in functions***
```
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: false}));
```
  JSON: raw, and pick json        
```
app.use(express.json());
```
***w/o using Middleware, req.body will be ```undefined``***
- put

- delete

### middleware - parse the post body to get what user submmit

- install: body parser 
  - is builded in newest version, no need to download
  
- form:

```
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: false}));
```

- json
```
app.use(express.json());
```


### post method syntax
```
app.post('/', (req, res) => {
    // access data comes from post request
    console.log(req.body);
    res.send("Data submitted!")
})
```

a function can be a const.
```

  console.log("hi")
}
```

## OBJECT SYNTAX================TO BE CONTINUED========================================


## template string

- use this signal "\`":   
`put your string here, remember variable with ${}`

```
const name = "sally";
const age = 36;
const pet = "horse";
function greeting(){
	console.log(`hi, ${name}, you seem to be ${age-10}. how lovely the ${pet} is`)
}
```

## default argument
```
function superGreeting(name="there", age="30", pet="horse"){
	return (`hi ${name}, you seem to be ${age-10}. how lovely your ${pet}`)
}

superGreeting();
```
=> "hi there, you seem to be 20. how lovely your horse"


## arrow function
```
funtion add(a,b){
  return a+b;
}
```
===
```
const add2 = (a,b) => a+b;
```

## a new type: symbol
(we don't use it often)
- symbol are used to create unique type.
- mostly used as identifier for object properties.
```
let sym1 = Symbol();
let sym2 = Symbol("foo");
let sym3 = Symbol("foo");
```
```
let compare = (sym2 === sym3)? "yes":"no";
console.log(compare)
```
=> no

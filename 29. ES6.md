- use this signal `put your string here, remember variable with ${}`

## default argument


## arrow function
```
funtion add(a,b){
  return a+b;
}
```

const add2 = (a,b) => a+b;
```

## a new type: symbol
(we don't use it often)
- symbol are used to create unique type.
- mostly used as identifier for object properties.
```

let compare = (sym2 === sym3)? "yes":"no";
console.log(compare)

# CASE 1. npm install failure after clone the project

## npm install with `--legacy-peer-deps`
- to avoid vertion incompatilbility
- still fail

## incompatibility on mac M1
- upgrade gatsby from v3.0 to at least v3.3 solves the problem [ofiicial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v3.3/)

## upgade without break the project
- view what version is compatible from [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v3.3/)
- see upgraade guide [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/upgrade-gatsby-and-dependencies/)
- manually change version in package.json (depende on what you need to add ^ caret or not)
- see what version will you upgrade with:
`npm outdated`, it will tell you the updating vertion and the latest version
- run `npm update --legacy-peer-deps`


## check what version a dependency is now 
- check it on npm website with package name

## run it 
- `gatsby develop`
// running on  http://localhost:8000/
- `gatsby build` then `gatsby serve`
// running on  http://localhost:9000/

# check the current version
- check on `package-lock.json`

```
{
  "name": "gatsby-starter-default",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "lockfileVersion": 2,
  "requires": true,
  "packages": {...},
  // packages -> dependencies: the version that write on package.json
  "dependencies": {...},
  // the actual version this project uses
 }
 ```

# CASE 1. npm install failure after clone the project

## npm install with `--legacy-peer-deps`
- to avoid vertion incompatilbility
- still fail

## incompatibility on mac M1
- upgrade gatsby from v3.0 to at least v3.3 solves the problem [ofiicial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v3.3/)

## upgade without break the project
- view what version is compatible from [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/v3.3/)
- see upgraade guide [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/release-notes/upgrade-gatsby-and-dependencies/)
- manually change version in package.json (depende on what you need to add ^ caret or not)
- see what version will you upgrade with:
`npm outdated`, it will tell you the updating vertion and the latest version
- run `npm update --legacy-peer-deps`


## check what version a dependency is now 
- check it on npm website with package name

## run it 
- `gatsby develop`
// running on  http://localhost:8000/
- `gatsby build` then `gatsby serve`
// running on  http://localhost:9000/

# check the current version
- check on `package-lock.json`

```
{
  "name": "gatsby-starter-default",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "lockfileVersion": 2,
  "requires": true,
  "packages": {...},
  // packages -> dependencies: the version that write on package.json
  "dependencies": {...},
  // the actual version this project uses
 }
 ```
 
# CASE 2. clone my gastby-portfolio, npm install with `--legacy-peer-deps`, still failed.
## ERROR: from vip, SOLUTION: install vip globally via brew
- https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/2049
> Fixed the error by installing vips lib globally brew install vips in Mac OS M1.

### brew installation and setting
- installation command: https://brew.sh/ 
> wait until there is a success message
> Fixed the error by installing vips lib globally `brew install vips` in Mac OS M1.

- error: `zsh: command not found: brew`
- follow these steps to set path for brew in `/zshrc`

## npm install ERROR: node-sass ; SOLUTION: replace it with sass
- remove `node-sass` and `gatsby-plugin-sass` from `package.json`
- delete `package-lock` and `yarn-lock`
- install back sass and its plugin `npm install sass gatsby-plugin-sass --legacy-peer-deps`

### now the project is running with `gatsby develop`!


## upgrade to gatsby v.3 from v.2
- `npm outdated` see current version and latest version
- change gataby-related package in package.json (手動改版本號)

```json
    "gatsby": "^3.0.1",
    "gatsby-image": "^2.4.7",
    "gatsby-plugin-manifest": "^3.0.0",
    "gatsby-plugin-offline": "^4.0.0",
    "gatsby-plugin-react-helmet": "^4.0.0",
    "gatsby-plugin-sass": "^5.21.0",
    "gatsby-plugin-sharp": "^3.0.0",
    "gatsby-source-filesystem": "^3.0.0",
    "gatsby-transformer-sharp": "^3.0.0",
```

### ERROR:  ERR! Could not resolve dependency SOLUTION: 把該套件的版本也一起升上去。

```jsx
npm ERR! Could not resolve dependency:
npm ERR! peer gatsby@"^2.2.0" from gatsby-source-filesystem@2.11.1
npm ERR! node_modules/gatsby-source-filesystem
npm ERR!   gatsby-source-filesystem@"^2.3.12" from the root project
```
```
"gatsby-source-filesystem": "^3.0.0",
```

### now gatsby is succesfully updated from 2.32.3 to 3.14.6, also update related plugins

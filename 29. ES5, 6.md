# EcmaScript === JavaScript

## babel
change the ES6 code so that every brower can read it.

## let

- with var, we can also create a new scope with function. 
inside a if {  }, there is the same scope with window.

- with let, wa can create a new scope with { }, functions or ifs.

** no more var again.

## const

- const is used when sth inchangable.   
a function can be a const.
```
const a = function (){
  console.log("hi")
}
```
## object as const

- a property of an object can be changed.

## DESTRUCTURE of object   =================================== NEW =====================================
```
const obj = {
	name: "vicky",
	level: 5,
	age: 30
};
```
- we can change the properties even when the obj type is const.
- so if you want to grab these value, your have to do this:
```
const name = obj.name;
const level = obj.level;
let level = obj.level;
```
- this is the short write:
```
const {name, level} = obj;
let {age} = obj; 
```

## dynamic object properties  =================================== NEW =====================================
```
const name = "jon snow";

const obj = {
[name] : "hello",
[9+7] : "hihi!"
}
```
=> then the obj will be:
```
{16: "hihi!", jon snow: "hello"}
16: "hihi!"
jon snow: "hello"
__proto__: Object
```

## template string

- use this signal "\`":   
`put your string here, remember variable with ${}`

```
const name = "sally";
const age = 36;
const pet = "horse";
function greeting(){
	console.log(`hi, ${name}, you seem to be ${age-10}. how lovely the ${pet} is`)
}
```

## default argument
```
function superGreeting(name="there", age="30", pet="horse"){
	return (`hi ${name}, you seem to be ${age-10}. how lovely your ${pet}`)
}

superGreeting();
```
=> "hi there, you seem to be 20. how lovely your horse"


## arrow function
```
funtion add(a,b){
  return a+b;
}
```
===
```
const add2 = (a,b) => a+b;
```

## a new type: symbol
(we don't use it often)
- symbol are used to create unique type.
- mostly used as identifier for object properties.
```
let sym1 = Symbol();
let sym2 = Symbol("foo");
let sym3 = Symbol("foo");
```
```
let compare = (sym2 === sym3)? "yes":"no";
console.log(compare)
```
=> no

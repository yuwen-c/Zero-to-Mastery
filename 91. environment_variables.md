## environment variable
- use for dynamic code, like port.
- Or a secret, like API keys

### hardcode way of assign port
```
const server = require('http').createServer((req, res)=> 
    res.end('oh hi there!'))      // import http module and create a server

server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log("server is running on port 3000")
}); // assign a channel

```

### process.env
- ```process.env```is the environment of this server
- to set the port, we can use```process.env.PORT```
```
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, ()=> {
    console.log(`it's running on port ${process.env.PORT}!`);
})


// if we don't assign a port, then it will run 3000
// and the console will be "it's running on port undefine"
```
- here, server listens to the first parameter, which is assigned to the port
```
app.listen(___ , () => {})
```
- to let the server know that it's from the environment, we add ```process.env``` in front of this parameter
- and, usually, we capitalize a constant
```
app.listen(process.env.PORT, () => {})
```
- the constant PORT can be replaced by any variable.
- and we can also do this to make it simpler:
```
const n = process.env.A
app.listen(n || 3000, ()=> {
    console.log(`it's running on port ${n}!`);
})
```
- this is also aceptable:
```
const PORT = process.env.PORT

server.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`server is running on port ${PORT}`)
});
```
- in terminal: (Bash), execute server and inject the variable
```
$ PORT = 3000 node server.js  // or use npm start instead: $ PORT=4000 npm start
```
or
```
$ PORT=3000 npm run start:dev // depend on setting of package.json
```
- in terminal: (fish)
- somehow I can run Bash command in fish terminal w/o error
```
$ env PORT = 3000 node server.js
```
***UPDATE***
- don't kknow why, but now I can not user bash command in fish
```
~/L/M/c/D/G/dieta-api (master ⚡) env PORT=3000 run npm start:dev
env: run: No such file or directory
~/L/M/c/D/G/dieta-api (master ⚡) PORT=3000 npm run start:dev    // this works

> dieta-api@1.0.0 start:dev /Users/marine/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/GitHub/dieta-api
> nodemon server.js
```

## a real view when running on Heroku with process.env.PORT
- left terminal is the server running on local computer, which ```process.env.Port``` is not assigned, but it does run on 3000.
- right terminal is the server running on Heroku, and it receives a Port 23760 that Heroku gave it.

### also can be used in DATABASE_URL
```
const DATABASE_URL = process.env.DATABASE_URL
server.listen(4000, () => {
    console.log(`server is running on database:  ${DATABASE_URL}`)
}); 
```

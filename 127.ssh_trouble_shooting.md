## test connection fail: 
- after setting ssh key to github, there is way to test connection:
`ssh -T git@github.com`
- turns to see this waring
`ssh: connect to host github.com port 22: Connection refused`

### option 1: change testing port
- [link](https://askubuntu.com/questions/610940/ssh-connect-to-host-github-com-port-22-connection-refused)
- `ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com`
```
 ~  ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
// yes
```

### option2: change wifi-connection
- may cause by firewall 
- change it and test again
```
 ~/Documents  ssh -T git@github.com

Hi yuwen-c! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

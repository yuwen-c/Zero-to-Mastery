## flexbox

- https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

- providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, 
even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word "flex").

- Note: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, 
and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.

## properties

```
container{
  display: flex;
}
```

```
justify-content: flex-end;
```
- to align items horizontally.

```
align-items: flex-end;
```
- to align items vertically.

```
flex-direction: row-reverse;
```
- to define the order of items.

```
order: 1;
```
- to change order by setting interger(-1,1...). (default:0)

```
align-self: flex-end;
```
- to align one item

```
flex-wrap: wrap;
```
- spread the items out to the next line.

```
flex-flow: column wrap;
```
- this is a combination of ``` flex-direction``` and ```flex-wrap```.

```
align-content: flex-start;
```
- ```align-content``` determines the spacing between lines,   
while ```align-items``` aligns items.



## another way to do horizontal centering

- ```margin: 0 auto``` is handy for horizontal centering.
	The element is given a specified width, then the left and right margins are set to auto.
	"horizontal only".
```
.head { 
	width: 200px; 
	margin: 0 auto;
}
```

### However, the ```margin: 0 auto``` does not work with every element

- Why can't I center with margin: 0 auto?

> An inline-block covers the whole line (from left to right), so a margin left and/or right won't work here. What you need is a block, a block has borders on the left and the right so can be influenced by margins.

```
#content {
display: block;
margin: 0 auto;
}
```

## flexbox

- https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

- providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, 
even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word "flex").

- Note: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, 
and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.

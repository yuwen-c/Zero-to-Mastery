# what is indempotent
- a function that always give us the same result

# is that not pure function?
- pure function also refers to "no side effect", no comunication with outside world
- an indempotent function can also console same result.

# some example
- a function that always console 5
- a delete user API call that no matter who we delete, the function always shows the same result (empty field)
- is used a lot in parralel and distributed computation
 

# why we need this?
- we can control our function perfectly since we know the result will be always the same


# addition
- even that a function calls itself, it still gets the same result
- like: 
```js
Math.abs(-50)

Math.abs(Math.abs(-50))

// always get 
```

## review
- in RAM: 1 address - 8 bits, => 1 byte
- 32 bits computer means it stores an 'a' with 32 bites => 4 bytes. (4*8=32)

## array
- sequential data structure, stored one by one, can get any element easily.
- smallest footprints than any other data structure.
- if you want to store some data and iterate over it => array

## methods and big O
- think of a 4-item-array storing in memory
- it takes 4 bytes* 4 items = 16 bytes to store it, and store continuously

### O(1): anything goes from behind
- push(): add one from behind
- pop(): throw one out from behind

### O(n): iterate over
- unshift(): add one from beginning
- splice(): add one from middle

## dynamic and static array
- some languages are required declaring an new array with size, such as C++
- this is a static array, fixed size.
- On the contrary, dynamic array, when you add a new item, and there is no room behind, computer will copies the original array, plus the new one, to a new space.
- There are ofter double spaces for the new dynamic array.
- with this background knowledge, now we know, an append() (like push()) method, Maybe take O(n) time.
- javascript is by default dynamic array.

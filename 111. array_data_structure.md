## review
- in RAM: 1 address - 8 bits, => 1 byte
- 32 bits computer means it stores an 'a' with 32 bites => 4 bytes. (4*8=32)

## array
- sequential data structure, stored one by one, can get any element easily.
- smallest footprints than any other data structure.
- if you want to store some data and iterate over it => array

## methods and big O
- think of a 4-item-array storing in memory
- it takes 4 bytes* 4 items = 16 bytes to store it, and store continuously

### O(1): anything goes from behind
- push(): add one from behind
- pop(): throw one out from behind

### O(n): iterate over
- unshift(): add one from beginning
- splice(): add one from middle

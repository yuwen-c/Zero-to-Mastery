## pass by value

- primitive types, pass by value.


## pass by reference

- object, pass by reference.
- array is simply object.

### clone an array by value

```
let arrayA = [1,2,3,4,5];
let arrayB = [].concat(arrayA);
```

### clone an object by value - shallow clone

```
let obj = {a:"a", b:"b", c:"c"};
```
1. 
```
let clone1 = Object.assign({},obj);
```
2. use spread operator.
```
let clone2 = {...obj};
```

### what if we have a complex object? - deep clone

```
let superClone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));
```

- but if you have a very huge complex object, then this method isn't recommended.

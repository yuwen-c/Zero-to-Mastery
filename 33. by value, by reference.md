## pass by value

- primitive types, pass by value.


## pass by reference

- object, pass by reference.
- array is simply object.

### clone an array by value

```
let arrayA = [1,2,3,4,5];
let arrayB = [].concat(arrayA);
```

### clone an object by value - SHALLOW CLONE ONLY
- if you have a complicate object, maybe another object as a value, then this clone won't copy by value until the deepest.

```
let obj = {a:"a", b:"b", c:"c"};
```
- one way to do shallow clone:
```
let clone1 = Object.assign({},obj);
// first parameter: an empty object you want to copy to
// second parameter: the source, from which you copy
```
- another: (use spread operator)
```
let clone2 = {...obj};
```

### what if we have a complex object? - deep clone

```
let superClone = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj));

// that is: first, turn every key-value pairs of the obj to a string JSON; 
//          then parse to the original object format.
```

- but if you have a very huge complex object, then doing JSON will have a performance implication, it'll take time to do these parsings.
- also, JSON DOES NOT clone function, undefine, and Symbol.

- only import clonedeep function seperately, don't import whole library.

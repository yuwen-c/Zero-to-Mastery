# in JS, object is a hash table
# hash?
- pass the key to a hash function, it will decide which address(bit address) to save the key and value. (in the same place!)

# hash function
- with the same input, hash function will going to return the same hash. (idempotent)
- we cannot get the input with it's hash
- SHA-1 hash, SHA-256 hash, the difference is the complexity, and speed

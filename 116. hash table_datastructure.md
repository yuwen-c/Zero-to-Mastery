# in JS, object is a hash table
# hash?
- pass the KEY to a hash function, it will get a hash and map it to an address(bit address) to save both key and value. (in the same place!)

# hash function
- with the same input, hash function will going to return the same hash. (idempotent)
- we cannot get the input with it's hash
- SHA-1 hash, SHA-256 hash, the difference is the time complexity
- hash function that used by hash table is very fast , O(1)

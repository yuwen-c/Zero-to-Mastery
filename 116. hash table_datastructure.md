# in JS, object is a hash table
# hash?
- pass the KEY to a hash function, it will get a hash and map it to an address(bit address) to save both key and value. (in the same place!)

# hash function
- with the same input, hash function will going to return the same hash. (idempotent)
- we cannot get the input with it's hash
- SHA-1 hash, SHA-256 hash, the difference is the time complexity
- hash function that used by hash table is very fast , O(1)


# time complexity of basic methods of hash table
- insert, loopup, delete, they are all O(1)
- however, there is something called collision, that sometimes different value share the same address. => **linked list**
- this slows down methods.

# in many language, there are Map and Set data structure
- Map, similar to object, but maintains the insertion order which in object is not.
- also, map can store anything as a key, even a function, where in object, the key is always string
- Set, only stores keys, not values

# implement a hashTable
- imagin that we create a hashTable class which has a defined size.
- all data stored as array
- has a ```_hash``` function, ```_``` means private property that you can access outside of class.
```

# in JS, object is a hash table
# hash?
- pass the KEY to a hash function, it will get a hash and map it to an address(bit address) to save both key and value. (in the same place!)

# hash function
- with the same input, hash function will going to return the same hash. (idempotent)
- we cannot get the input with it's hash
- SHA-1 hash, SHA-256 hash, the difference is the time complexity
- hash function that used by hash table is very fast , O(1)


# time complexity of basic methods of hash table
- insert, loopup, delete, they are all O(1)
- however, there is something called collision, that sometimes different value share the same address. => **linked list**
- this slows down methods.

# in many language, there are Map and Set data structure
- Map, similar to object, but maintains the insertion order which in object is not.
- also, map can store anything as a key, even a function, where in object, the key is always string
- Set, only stores keys, not values

# implement a hashTable
1. imagine that we create a hashTable class which has a defined size.
2. all data stored as array
3. has a ```_hash``` function, ```_``` means private property that you can access outside of class.
4. define it's own methods: set, get
```
class HashTable{
  constructor(size){
    this.data = new Array(size)
  }
  
  // desides which shelf should store the pair
  _hash(){
    ...
    return hash
  }
  
  // the uniqle pair in a shelf => no problem; repeat address => linked list [ <1 empty item>, [ [ 'grapes', 10050 ], [ 'apples', 50 ] ] ]
  set(key, value){
        const index = this._hash(key);
        // deal with collision
        if(!this.data[index]){
            // this.data[index] = [key, value]
            // 這個寫法會讓linked list的結構錯誤：[ <1 empty item>, [ 'grapes', 10050, [ 'apples', 50 ] ] ]
            this.data[index] = [];        
            // 正確結構：[ <1 empty item>, [ [ 'grapes', 10050 ], [ 'apples', 50 ] ] ]
        }
        this.data[index].push([key, value])
  }

  get(key){
        const index = this._hash(key);
        const indexEle = this.data[index]; // 一直重複叫用，乾脆另取名，且太多層不好閱讀
        if(indexEle){
            for(let i = 0; i< indexEle.length; i++){
                if(indexEle[i][0] === key){
                    return indexEle[i][1];
                }
            }
        }
        else{ // 要顧及沒有物件時的回傳
            return undefined
        }
  }
  
  keys(){
    let keysArr = [];
    for(let i=0; i<this.data.length; i++){
      if(this.data[i]){
        keysArr.push(this.data[i][0][0]) //[0] to get things out from a two-dimentional array: [...['grapes', 10050], ...['apples', 50], ...['guave', 20]]
      }
    }
    return keysArr;
  }
}

const myHashTable = new HashTable(2)  // may has a collision especially when the size(number of shelves) is small 
myHashTable.set('grapes', 10050);
myHashTable.set('apples', 50);
myHashTable.set('guave', 20)
console.log(myHashTable.get('apples'));
```
**so we can see, hash function, set function are O(1), while get method depends, maybe an O(n) (a for loop)**

# down side of hashtable - keys() method
- add a keys method to get an array with all keys in myHashTable in the above
// [ 'guava', 'grapes', 'apples' ]

## conclusion
- 即使只有加入3個項目，要得到keys，仍然需要loop through 50個item => bad than array
```
for in... is a slow method
```
- 加入的順序你無法掌控，randomly，即使grapes比guava早加，放置的順序你無法掌控(順序：[ 'guava', 'grapes', 'apples' ])

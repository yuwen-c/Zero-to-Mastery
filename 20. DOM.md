- DOM comes from Document Object Model.

- when we load a page, first we get HTML file, then through <link>, we get CSS files,     
using these two files, the browser creates a DOM.

- DOM is simply document????????)

- DOM is created by browser that allows us to change HTML and CSS.

- Theoratically if we want to change HTML and CSS, we need to load again HTML and CSS file,   
 but with JS, we can talk with DOM, and we can change them while user is on the page.
 
-  ** WINDOW is the object that describes the browser.   
  ??????browser create a WINDOW object, which is the parent object of DOCUMENT object,is the parent of everything.
  
 ```
 alert("hey you!");
 ```
 ```
 window.alert("hey you!");
 ```
   - are the same thing. if you don't specify the object, it assumes that you are talking about WINDOW object.
 

 - WINDOW object has a DOCUMENT property that specifies what should get displayed.
 
 - DOCUMENT is the screen that we see in the browser, and it's an object is the screen.
 
 - Each browser has its own JS engine, which reads JS files line by line, and execute them.
 
 - through JS, we get connection with DOM. 
 - By DOCUMENT object, use its property like ```document.write( );```, we change the DOM.

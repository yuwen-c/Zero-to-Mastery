- DOM comes from Document Object Model.

- when we load a page, first we get HTML file, then through <link>, we get CSS files,     
using these two files, the browser creates a DOM.

- DOM is simply document????????)

- Theoratically if we want to change HTML and CSS, we need to load again HTML and CSS file,   
 but with JS, we can change them while user is on the page.
 
-  ** WINDOW is the object that describes the browser.   
  ??????browser create a WINDOW object, which is the parent object of DOCUMENT object,is the parent of everything.
  
 ```
 alert("hey you!");
 ```
 ```
 window.alert("hey you!");
 ```
   - are the same thing. if you don't specify the object, it assumes that you are talking about WINDOW object.
 

 - WINDOW object has a DOCUMENT property that specifies what should get displayed.
 - DOCUMENT object is the screen, is what we see
 
 - Each browser has its own JS engine, which reads JS files line by line, and execute them.
 
 - through JS, we get connection with DOM. 
 - By DOCUMENT object, use its property like ```document.write( );```, we change the DOM.

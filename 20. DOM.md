## DOM, Document Object Model

- when we load a page, first we get HTML file, then through <link>, we get CSS files,     
using these two files, the browser creates a DOM.

- DOM comes from Document Object Model. 

- Theoretically, if we want to change HTML and CSS, we need to load again HTML and CSS file.   

- We can access DOM through DOCUMENT object, and through JS, change the HTML and CSS while user is on the page.


## document object

- In console, DOM is DOCUMENT, an object.

- DOCUMENT is the screen that we see in the browser, and it's an object.

- DOCUMENT specifies what should get displayed in a browser.


## window object

- WINDOW is the object that describes the browser.   
 
- WINDOW is the biggest parent of everything in a browser and is also the parent object of DOCUMENT object.

- WONDOW has some properties like alert():

```
alert("hey you!");
```
```
window.alert("hey you!");
```
- they are the same things. if we don't specify the object, it assumes that you are talking about WINDOW object.


## Javascript Engine

- Each browser has its own JS engine, which reads JS files line by line, and execute them.
 
- By DOCUMENT object, use its property like ```document.write( );```, we change the DOM.

## resume

- A web browser has a WINDOW object that has a property DOCUMENT that specifies what should get displayed

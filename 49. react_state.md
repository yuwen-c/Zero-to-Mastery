## state
- state is the description of your App, the state is simply an object that descripbe your application
- the state in this project:
  - {robots}
  - what entered the searchbox
- state can be changed

- props are things that come out of state.
- parent feeds a state to a child, then the child has a property, and it cannot be changed.


## setState
- setState is async function, so we won't get the actual value through ```this.state.```...
- use callback function to get the actual value:
```
this.setState({property: value}, () => console.log(this.state))
```


###

This is exactly why setState is async.

React does a bunch of things in the background after it encounters a setState command.

One of the things is, that it awaits until the state receives the new value.

Then it executes the render method which results in a refresh of the data.

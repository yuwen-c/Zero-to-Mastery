## state
- state is the description of your App, the state is simply an object that descripbe your application
- the state in this project:
  - {robots}
  - what entered the searchbox
- state can be changed

- props are things that come out of state.
- parent feeds a state to a child, then the child has a property, and it cannot be changed.    
***a series of similar data, can save in one state with type of array, instead of having lots of single state.*** 

## setState
- setState is async function, so we won't get the actual value through ```this.state.```...
- use callback function to get the actual value:
```
this.setState({property: value}, () => console.log(this.state))
```


### ps

This is exactly why setState is async.

React does a bunch of things in the background after it encounters a setState command.

One of the things is, that it awaits until the state receives the new value.

Then it executes the render method which results in a refresh of the data.





## an issue that happened to me
- there is an empty Activity array in state, I want to setState one element at a time, 7 elements in total.  

### first try, const a new empty array and setstate Activity at the end
```
fun = (event) => {
  const newArr = [];
  newArr[index] = event.target.value
  this.setState({Activity : newArr})
}
```
- basically it's wrong, the newArr get restart everytime, and at last I just got one element

### second try, find a solution in stack overflow. New a copy of this.state
- the solution comes from here:    
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39941734/how-can-i-insert-into-reacts-state-array-with-setstate/39943308#39943308
```
// example code
let new_state = Object.assign({}, this.state); 
let a = new_state.arr;
a[index] = "random element";
this.setState({arr: a});
```
- then I change it to my variables, and it seems work:
  - I can console log this.state.Activity
  - but in render part ```{this.state.Activity} ```does't work
  - only the ```{this.state.Activity[0]}``` can run.
  
- then I suddenly found that, I haven't change one variable: ```this.setState({arr : a})```, it should have been ```this.setState({Activity : a})```
- also, some response below also said that it was a wrong answer, you never mutate a state.

### thrid try, New a copy of this.state with different way
- it's simplier, no Object.assign involved.
```
fun = (event) => {
  let newArr = this.state.Activity;
  newArr[index] = event.target.value
  this.setState({Activity : newArr})
}
```
- it seems work too.
- and I read the most voted answer, which is the next try

### fourth try. New a SEPERATED copy of Activity state.
![pic](https://i.stack.imgur.com/GeeaZ.jpg)
```
// example code
let a = this.state.arr.slice(); //creates the clone of the state
a[index] = "random element";
this.setState({arr: a});
```
- if you directly assign this, it passes by reference. so when you mutate the a variable, state also be changed at the same time
```
let a = this.state.Activity
```
- change state w/o using setState, it'll cause unnormal render
- so the right way of copy is a pass by value copy
- in the example, ```slice()``` returns a new array, it makes sure that you don't change state accidentially
```
// eventually, my code is:
fun = (event) => {
  let newArr = this.state.Activity.slice();
  newArr[index] = event.target.value
  this.setState({Activity : newArr})
}
```
- finanlly ```{this.state.Activity}``` renders well

***make sure you do a seperate copy of an array or an object when trying to modify state***
***always render your state to screen to make sure it works normally***     
- just put ```{ this.state.foofoo }```in the return of parent component, or the ```props``` in child component
- ```Boolean``` can not be render, need a ```toString()```
- a undefine state(maybe you'll set in the next step) will pass and just console undefine, but if render state[0], then system crashes.  

## the application of Object.assign
- in smartbrain, after user log in, we got the data of user in our page
- and user passes an url, meanwhile, we connect to database, do the increment, and send back the entries date.
- if we ```the.setState({users:{ entries: data })``` will setState the whole user object, so we lose user name in the screen. 
- so we do:
```
.then(count => this.setState(Object.assign(this.state.user, {entries: count}))) 
```
- ```Object.assign``` assigns a latter object to a former object
- so here we assign the new entries to the original state, which is ```this.state.user```

### ```Object assign```: to combine objects
- https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign
```
有相同屬性時合併物件
var o1 = { a: 1, b: 1, c: 1 };
var o2 = { b: 2, c: 2 };
var o3 = { c: 3 };

var obj = Object.assign({}, o1, o2, o3);
console.log(obj); // { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }，屬性c為o3.c的值，最後一個出現的屬性c。
所有的屬性會被後方相同屬性名稱的值覆寫。
```
- combine o1, o2, o3 to an empty {}
- o2 will overwirte o1, o3 will overwrite o2, if they have the same properties.

## OBJECT SHALLOW COPY ISSUE
- To renew a user after sign out, I wrote:
```
constructor() {
  this.state = initialState;
}
```
***which was dengarous!! It copied initial state BY REFERENCE, and I'll accidentally mutate the initialState.***

### initialState got mutated issue
- curiously, it didn't show any bug if we refresh user like this:
```
loadUserFromServer = (data) => {
  this.setState({user : data});
}
```
- but if we try to set a iner property, then initialState will be changed.
```
loadUserFromServer = (data) => {
  this.setState(Object.assign(this.state.user, {name: data.name, email: data.email}));
  // data is an user object that passed from server.
}
```

### the first layer of state seems passed by value, when we setState the first layer, the initialstate doesn't get effected.
- do a simple testing in chrome console, we can find that a pass by reference copy just like 
```
const obj2 = obj1;
```
we can easily mutate obj2.property with changing obj1.property.

- however in this case:
```
this.state = initialState
```
- even if we setState the first layer
```
this.setState({input : 'testInput'})
```
the initialState doesn't get affected!!! 
***DON"T KNOW WHY, but it seems that in constructor, a pass by reference clone doesn't affect the initialState***


## POINT 1: use pass by value clone of object
- just do JSON copy to avoid any pass by reference issue
- (may cause data loose if you have a function inside)
```
this.state = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(initialState));
```

### POINT 2: use setState API correctly.
- when setState a single property inside the second layer, do another seperate copy first:
```
another way to setState
this.setState(prevState => {
  let user = Object.assign({}, prevState.user);  // creating copy of state variable user [ with the same name in state!!! ]
  user.entries = 'new count';                     // update the entries property, assign a new value                 
  return { user };                                 // return new object user object
})
```
- and use prevState instead of ```this.state.user```, since it maybe not the ***latest*** state

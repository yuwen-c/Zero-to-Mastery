## platforms for app
- Heroku is a platform that can put your app on 
- traditional platform, like hostgator, uses apache server, suits for content website, just hang on those files.
- some famous choice for deploy app: 
  - amazon webservice
  - digital ocean
  - engine yard
  - Heroku

## plan
- front-end => git-pages
- server => Heroku
- database => Heroku

## steps

### sign up Heroku

### installation
- install Heroku CLI in server project
- use documentation

### some Heroku commands
- run the app
```
heroku open
```
- see remote repo
```
git remote -v - to see the remote repo
```
(you'll see new we have 2 remote url and 2 local url)
- set remote repo
```
heroku...-a...
```
- see the records of server running, find where is the problem
```
heroku logs --tail
```

### issues
- PORT, we hardcode port 3000 but Heroku got it's own port, so use process.env.PORT
```
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000, () => {    // assign an environment variable or just use port 3000
  console.log('process.env.PORT')
}) 
```

- the get method of route: / , use "database", which doesn't exist anymore, so change it

### push
- after changing your code, do git add, commit and push to Heroku master...
***but git repo will changing automatically?***

### url
- after register your app on Heroku, it gives you a url
- it represents when you connect to this url, you connect to your server, which runs on Heroku computer
(before, we run it on localhost/3000 on our computer)
- so, theoratically, now we can replace the url on front end app with that url, to see if it works.
- basically, we can see an error message from catch, since we havn't connect the database.

## server
- is a computer that listens to request and send back files.

## use node.js build a server
- we run javascript in terminal, not in browser
- JS uses synchronous syntax to run code asynchronously, has better efficiency.

### step
- open a new folder named server.js
- import http module.
```
const httpMod = require('http');
```
- create a server
```
const server = httpMod.createServer(() => {
    console.log("I hear you! thanks for using this service.")
})
```
- add channel 3000, 3001 or any number
```
server.listen(3000);
```
- run the server file
```
$ node server.js
```
or 
(edit script to ```"start": "nodemon server.js"``` in package.json first)
```
$ npm start
```

**** every time when you connect to this certain host, in terminal it shows the console sentence.
=> means: a server listens to requests.

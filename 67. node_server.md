## server
- is a computer that listens to request and send back files.

## use node.js to build a server in my computer
- we run javascript in terminal, not in browser
- JS uses synchronous syntax to run code asynchronously, has better efficiency.

### steps
- open a new folder named server.js
- import http module.
***node comes with it's own http module***
```
const httpMod = require('http');
```
- create a server
```
const server = httpMod.createServer(() => {
    console.log("I hear you! thanks for using this service.")
})
```
- add port 3000, 3001 or any number
```
server.listen(3000);
```
- run the server file
```
$ node server.js
```
or 
(edit script to ```"start": "nodemon server.js"``` in package.json first)
```
$ npm start
```
- then we pretend that we are a user requesting on this website on port 3000 
```
// in server terminal:

I hear you! thanks for using this service.
```
***Imaging that you are an user from another computer, using browser to connect to a server which made in your terminal
=> so the "console.log" will show on terminal, not browser***

***every time when you connect to this certain host, in terminal it shows the console sentence.     
=> means: a server listens to requests.***

### request and response
- Set the response head type and body    
after connecting, in console "network" shows 200, get...
```
const server = httpMod.createServer(() => {
    response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
    response.end("<h1>server test</h1>");
}
```
- we can also know the request data
```
const server = httpMod.createServer(() => {
    console.log(request.headers); // host: 'localhost:3000',......
    console.log(request.method); // method GET
    console.log(request.url);  // url /favicon.ico
    response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
    response.end("<h1>server test</h1>");
}
```
#### response a JSON format
```
const server = httpMod.createServer(() => {
    const userObj = {
        name: 'judy',
        age: 40
    }
    response.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
    response.end(JSON.stringify(userObj));
}
```



***There are many way to build a server. like: express.***

## server
- is a computer that listens to request and send back files.

## use node.js to build a server in my computer
- we run javascript in terminal, not in browser
- JS uses synchronous syntax to run code asynchronously, has better efficiency.

### steps
- open a new folder named server.js
- import http module.
```
const httpMod = require('http');
```
- create a server
```
const server = httpMod.createServer(() => {
    console.log("I hear you! thanks for using this service.")
})
```
- add port 3000, 3001 or any number
```
server.listen(3000);
```
- run the server file
```
$ node server.js
```
or 
(edit script to ```"start": "nodemon server.js"``` in package.json first)
```
$ npm start
```

**** Imaging that you are an user from another computer, using browser to connect to a server which made in your terminal

**** every time when you connect to this certain host, in terminal it shows the console sentence.     
=> means: a server listens to requests.

### request and response
- Set the response head type and body    
after connecting, in console "network" shows 200, get...
```
const server = httpMod.createServer(() => {
    response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
    response.end("<h1>server test</h1>");
}
```
- we can also know the request data

```
const server = httpMod.createServer(() => {
    console.log(request.headers);
    console.log(request.method); // method GET
    console.log(request.url);  // url /favicon.ico
    response.setHeader("Content-Type", "text/html");
    response.end("<h1>server test</h1>");
}
```

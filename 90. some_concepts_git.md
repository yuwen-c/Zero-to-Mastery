-```-u``` just ```sets the upstream```

### some questions in interview
https://5xruby.tw/posts/git-interview/


## git push <remote name> <branch name>
https://zlargon.gitbooks.io/git-tutorial/content/remote/push.html  
- to upload master to github
```
$ git push github master        # 不需要先 checkout 到 master branch //
```
- it will upload local master to remote master.
- if there isn't a master branch, then it'll make one.
- no matter which branch are you on, it will upload the SAME NAME branch.

### origin means remote repo
https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/glossary/origin
> What is the origin in Git?    
> In Git, "origin" is a shorthand name for the remote repository     
> that a project was originally cloned from.      
> More precisely, it is used instead of that original repository's URL - and thereby makes referencing much easier.    

### push to romote branch with different name
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5738797/how-can-i-push-a-local-git-branch-to-a-remote-with-a-different-name-easily
> Sure. Just set your ```push.default``` to upstream to push branches to their upstreams    
> (which is the same that pull will pull from, defined by branch.newb.merge),    
> rather than pushing branches to ones matching in name (which is the default setting for push.default, matching).    
>    
> ```git config push.default upstream```


## if you edit your repo directly on github page, you cause a difference between remote and local
- this happened after I attached some pic to edit my readme file.
- so next time you do push, becomes an error.
```
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/yuwen-c/smartcomputer.git'
```
- now: your have to merge 2 repos
- https://gitbook.tw/chapters/github/pull-from-github.html
- ```git pull = git fetch + git merge```
- after merging them, do git push


## push your branch to the parent repo. (a PR with branch name)
- https://sqldbawithabeard.com/2019/11/29/how-to-fork-a-github-repository-and-contribute-to-an-open-source-project/
- if you make fork of a parent repo, open a branch and make some change
- now you want to make a PR, and you want to push as this branch name
- the process will be: push branch to your forked repo, then PR to parent repo.
- but before pushing to your repo, you need a corresponding branch on your repo too.
- so use this command:
```
~/L/M/c/D/G/GitDemo (fixName →) git commit -m "fix me last name, and change the repo link(the original one is invalid)"
[fixName 7392d8c] fix me last name, and change the repo link(the original one is invalid)
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
~/L/M/c/D/G/GitDemo (fixName) git push --set-upstream origin fixName   // add remote and push at the same time
```
- after that, you can see a green PR on github page. 
- go edit and send it.\
**note, your remote repo master has not been changed, you can check the changes on the fixName branch**

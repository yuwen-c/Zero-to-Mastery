### some questions in interview

## git push <remote name> <branch name>
https://zlargon.gitbooks.io/git-tutorial/content/remote/push.html  
- to upload master to github
```
$ git push github master        # 不需要先 checkout 到 master branch //
```
- it will upload local master to remote master.
- if there isn't a master branch, then it'll make one.
- no matter which branch are you on, it will upload the SAME NAME branch.

### origin means remote repo
https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/glossary/origin
> What is the origin in Git?    
> In Git, "origin" is a shorthand name for the remote repository     
> that a project was originally cloned from.      
> More precisely, it is used instead of that original repository's URL - and thereby makes referencing much easier.    

### push to romote branch with different name

> Sure. Just set your ```push.default``` to upstream to push branches to their upstreams    
> (which is the same that pull will pull from, defined by branch.newb.merge),    
> rather than pushing branches to ones matching in name (which is the default setting for push.default, matching).    
>    
> ```git config push.default upstream```

## promise

- promise comes from ES6,
- it's used for asynchronous function but in a more clear way.   
it avoids the nested syntax of asynchronous.

- it doesn't matter how many time the functions will wait,      
it takes care of how to react with them when time's up.

- when a promise has got used, it will return a value in the future.
  - fulfill,(resolve)
  - reject,
  - pending

## syntax:

```
const promiseA = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  if (resolve){
  }
  else (reject){
  }
})

promiseA
.then(resule => )
```

- if something wrong, use catch

```
promiseA
.then(result => {   })
.then(result2 => {
  throw Error;
  ...
})
.catch(error => console.log(error))

```
if there are more then one promises,
then use ```Promise.all([array of promise])```
```
Promise.all([promiseA, promiseB, PromiseC, promiseD])
.then(result => { })

```
- the returned value will be also an array.
- when all the promises are resolved, it executes the statement in one time.


### in real world:

- we call data from server.
```
const urls=[
url1,
url2,
url3]

Promise.all(urls.map(url => 
fetch(url).then(response => response.json()))
.then(result => {
console.log(result[0]);
console.log(result[1]);
console.log(result[2])
});

```
## When do we need promise?

- asynchronous work, like get data from data base
- make an API call
- optimize an image

- promise comes from ES6,
- it's used for asynchronous function but in a more clear way.   
it avoids the nested syntax of asynchronous.

- it doesn't matter how many time the functions will wait,      
it takes care of how to react with them when time's up.

- when a promise has got used,
it will return a value in the future.
fulfill,(resolve)
reject,
pending

## syntax:

```
const promiseA = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  if (resolve){
  }
  else (reject){
  }
})

promiseA
.then(resule => )
```

- if something wrong, use catch

```
promiseA
.then(result => {   })
.then(result2 => {
  throw Error;
  ...
})
.catch(error => console.log(error))

```
if there are more then one promises,
then use ```Promise.all([array of promise])```
```
Promise.all([promiseA, promiseB, PromiseC, promiseD])
.then(result => { })

```
- the returned value will be also an array.

- When do we need promise?
  - asynchronous work, like get data from data base
  - make an API call
  - optimize an image

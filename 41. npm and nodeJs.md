## npm - Node Package Manager.
- npm is a version contrill system
- anyone can put his package/ module in there, and it contains 2 parts: package.json & javascript file.
- package.json is a file that describes your package, can manage the dependencies.
- now a day people start a file with:
  - html + css + js
  - github repo + git
  - package.json

## node.js
- let us run JS "outside" of browser.
- download: https://nodejs.org/en/ 
- install node.js, and npm comes with it

- after installing, try: 
```
$ node -v
$ npm -v
```
- if the version shows up, then it works!

## start using package.json

- go to your project folder, initialize one:
```
$ npm init -y    // -y: skip settings
```
- it creates a ```package.json``` file in the folder.


## download packages

- globally: in the computer
  - ```-g```
  - can be ran in terminal.
- locally: only in the certain folder

### live-server

```
npm install -g live-server
```
- not working, try ```sudo```

=> + live-server@1.2.1

- run this command
```
$ live-server
```
- it creates a fake server, and watch the changes.    

=>
Ready for changes
GET /favicon.ico 404 2.618 ms - 150

- the address of website changes:
```
open manually:
file:///Users/marine/Documents/card/index.html

open with $ live-server:  (it creates a virtual server)
http://127.0.0.1:8080/

open with build-in server of VS code:
http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html
```

***VS code has a build-in live server: right click -> open with live server***





### lodash

- lots of functions
```
$ npm install lodash
```
=> + lodash@4.17.15

- check the package.json file, there is:
```
"dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.15"
```
- means: add a dependency to our project.
- check the folder, there is a node_modules.

### how to know the lodash function works in our js?

#### use in js file:
```
import { without } loadsh;  // the module syntax
console.log(without)
```
but it doesn't run in console because the browser doesn't support it.


#### use require in node.js
1. download browserify
```
$ sudo nmp install -g browserify
```
=> + browserify@16.5.0
2. because we give browserify a js file, it outputs another module bundler for browser, run this:
```
$ browserify script.js > bundle.js
```
- a "bundle.js" appears in the folder.
3. now we have to connect out html file to this bundle file,   
so change the src to bundle.js
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="bundle.js"></script>
```
4. try some function in lodash.
```
var _ = require('lodash');

var array = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7];
// use without method in lodash:
console.log("the answer goes to: ", _.without(array, 3));
```
5. update the bundle again
```
browserify script.js > bundle.js
```
6. then the answer shows in console.



## advantage

- because the node.js is massive, it's not nesserary put it on github.    
only the package.json file is required,
then a new developer can just download it with this command:
```
$ npm install
```

## dev dependency

- is packages for developers and testing.
- users cannot see it.
- it's deleted automatically when releasing the product.

## test part in package.json

- we can see this in package.json
```
"scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
```
- change it to this:
```
"scripts": {
    "test": "browserify script.js > bundle.js" 
  },
```
- then when we run ```$ npm run test```, it updates the bundle.    
also, we can run live-server automatically.
```
 "scripts": {
    "test": "browserify script.js > bundle.js && live-server"
  },
```

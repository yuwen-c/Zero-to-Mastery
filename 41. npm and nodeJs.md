## node.js
- let us run JS outside of browser.
- download: https://nodejs.org/en/
- after installing, try: 
```
$ node -v
$ npm -v
```
- if the version shows up, then it works!

## start

- go to your project folder,
```
$ npm init 
```
- it creates a ```package.json``` file in the folder.


## download packages

- globally: in the computer
  - ```-g```
  - can be ran in terminal.
- locally: only in the certain folder

### live-server

```
npm install -g live-server
```
- not working, try ```sudo```

=> + live-server@1.2.1

- run this command
```
$ live-server
```
- it creates a fake server, and watch the changes.

### lodash

- lots of functions
```
$ npm install lodash
```
=> + lodash@4.17.15

- check the package.json file, there is:
```
"dependencies": {
    "lodash": "^4.17.15"
```
- means: add a dependency to our project.
- check the folder, there is a node_modules.

### how to know the lodash function works in our js?

#### use in js file:
```
import { without } loadsh;  // the module syntax
console.log(without)
```
but it doesn't run in console because the browser doesn't support it.


#### use require in node.js
1. download browserify
```
$ sudo nmp install -g browserify
```
=> + browserify@16.5.0
2. because we give browserify a js file, it outputs another module bundler for browser, run this:
```
$ browserify script.js > bundle.js
```
- a "bundle.js" appears in the folder.
3. now we have to connect out html file to this bundle file,   
so change the src to bundle.js
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="bundle.js"></script>
```
4. try some function in lodash.

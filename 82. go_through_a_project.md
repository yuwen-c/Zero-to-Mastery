## front end
- components, layout.
- add functionality(button, input. onChange, onClick)
- connect API (face-recognition)     
***in this stage, just use fake data to modify database***

### layout:
- tachyons default: for small screen (mobile)
- use ```-ns``` for none-mobile screen
- there are default, ```-ns``` (not small), ```-m``` (medium), ```-l``` (large)
- like ```className="ph1 ph3-ns ph5-l"```

### figure out the css setting with selector of chrome
- point out the range of certain tag
- observe the css of the upper layer and the tag itself, cancel that css on the right hand side, to see if it effects your layout.

## routing
- a plan for signIn, signOut: where should it go? what navigation should be put on the screen?
- add a route function with page parameter to direct to that page.      
***an arrow function in child component is needed***    

### decide the display of screen depends on state
- can use ternary operator in return, with curly brackets
  - both results should put in a pair of <div>
  - if there are 3 conditions, then use a double ternary operator
- also, a if/else statement outside of return

## server end    
(see server files for more details)        
***open a new empty normal file (not react), run ```npm init``` to get ```package.json```***           
***install nodemon to monitor changes and run it automatically.*** (```--save-dev``` and ```"start" : "nodemon script.js"```)           
***install express to build a server***        

- start with a ```server.js```
- a plan. what route, what method, bear what data, in head or body, url, response?
- base on the plan, write routes.
- test them with postman
- a fake database is needed. think of a table as an array, every row of data is an object.
- think what data you need to store, in what knid of type.    
***on server end, console.log will be in terminal of server***   
```
const database = {
    users:[
        {
            id: 123,
            name: "Judy",
            email: "judy@gmail.com",
            password: "123",
            entries: 0,
            joined: new Date()
        },
        {
            id: 124,
            name: "David",
            email: "david@gmail.com",
            password: "124",
            entries: 0,
            joined: new Date()
        }
    ],
    login:[
        {
            id: 123,
            password: ""
        },
        {
            id: 124,
            password: ""
        }
    ]
}
```
## connect server end to front end     
### CORS
***install cors (伺服器端存取控制) to allow to connect front end to server, since they are become different domain***       
- run one on port 3000 and the other on 3001
- test it with ```componentDidMount``` and ```fetch``` to see if they are connected

### Signin component and App container
- deal with the input information in this step, use setState to store input information 
- sign in with email and password => send to server => return user data
***so ideally, we can store loggin data in Signin component state, and save the complete user data in App container.*** 
- send message to the server using certain method like:
  - fetch("the address", setting)
  - setting: an object that describe this fetch
  ```
  {
   method: 'get'(default),     // post, put, delete
   headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
   body: {
    'email': 'foo@gmail.com'
   } // not by JS object but a JSON format.
  }
  ```
  - the body is by JSON format, can be transfered by ```JSON.stringify```
  ***read more detail about JSON <--> JS in 84.***      
```
this.grabFaceFun(response);
fetch('http://localhost:3000/image', {
  method: 'put',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify(this.state.user)
})

// here this.state.user is an object, actually it's like:

body: JSON.stringify({
    email: this.state.email, 
    password: this.state.password
})
```
- trigger parent setState in child component: call a parent function

## database   
***install knex to connect postgresql with server***    
***install bcrypt-nodejs, or latest version bcrypt, to encrypt password***    
- use knex syntax(SQL syntax) to re-write the server

## test it out with front end
- test all the buttons, input, links, routes with credentials.

***Missing part: should clear user data after sign out***
- we can assign a initial state to a variable, and every time signning out, setState.
```
// outside of App class
const initialState = {...}

// inside of reset function, usually the onRouteChange function
this.setState(initialState); // directly put the whole object
```
***Warning!!! Be aware if you copy the initial state BY REFERENCE!!*** 

## code review

### extract duplicate code
- sign in and register components have repeated code.
- extract it to another comopnent
***break down components so that they can be reuseable.***
- there are many ways of doing this, here is mine:
  - my first try is extract email and password divs to another component. that's easy.
  ***When you aren't sure what you're going to do, give it a easy try, then expand it***    
  > then I thought, I want it more dry, is it possible to make functions reusable?          
  > also I thought, a divided view is not clear. (In the previous version, I put name div and share component in Register)    
  - so I put 2 views in share component, add a ternary operator in return, but I need a condition to make this => so I pass App route as a prop to Register and next prop to share form. so did in Signin.
  - now, move the input onChange functions to share form.
  > I decided to let the state keep inside of Register and SignIn components.
  - so I add a setState funciton in parent component, pass it, and call it in share component.
  ***here I encounted a problem, a dynamic property name in object. use [ ]***
  - and that's it.
  

### add catch in every fetch. Error Handler
- ```fetch```, ```.then``` needs a ```.catch(console.log)``` behind.

***in ```catch```, use arrow function. If not, the code will be execute no matter what***

- do this then the error message will show up every time.
```
.catch(this.setState({errorMes: "failed: registration"}))
```
- the right way to do it, wrap it in arrow function 
```
.catch(() => {this.setState({errorMes: "failed: registration"})})
```



### group
- each component stays at it's own folder
- Mainly in an app, codes are put in ```src``` folder.
  - inside of it, a ```container folder``` includes app.js, app.css
  - another ```component folder``` contains small components, ErrorBoundary, Scroll...etc.
  - for a large project, each component has it's own folder.

> <pre>   src -> component -> Logo folder -> Logo.js      
>                                    Logo.css      
>                                    Logo.png      
>                  -> Navigation -> Navigation.js
>                                -> Navigation.css     </pre> 

  - ```index```, and ```serviceWorker.js``` stay in ```src``` folder.

## re-write server-end
- 原本的寫法：
```
// server.js
app.post('/user', (req, res) => { 
  ...
})
```
- 將每個endpoints分別獨立到各個檔案，可以放在一個名叫controllers的folder下。
- then we need to do module exports, and require. (see 63. node.js.md)
```
// server.js
  // 加上import
const register = require('path')
app.post('/register', register.handleRegister);

// controllers - register.js
const handleRegister = (req, res) =>{
  ...
}

  // 加上exports
module.exports = {             
  handleRegister: handleRegister
}
```
- 但此時run會出現錯誤，因為register檔案中並未說明```db```, ```bcrypt```
  - 解法1, 在register也import dependency, 像在server.js一樣。
  - 解法2, 在server.js做dependency injection
```
// server.js
app.post('/register', (req, res) => {register.handleRegister(req, res, db, bcrypt)});

// controllers - register.js
const handleRegister = ((req, res, db, bcrypt)) =>{
  ...
}

```
- a syntax more advanced:
```
// server.js
app.post('/register', register.handleRegister(db, bcrypt)});
  // handleRegister receives 2 parameter and returns a function.

// controllers - register.js
  // then when it receives the req, res parameters, the function got called, just like it's order here:
const handleRegister = (db, bcrypt) => (req, res) =>{
  ...
}

```


## validation
- validate not only the front end, but also the back end.
***never trust a data passed by front end, back end must do it's own validation***

### validation in front end
- no accept blank input
- a certain format of email
- more than 6 letters password

## security 
- in our previous setting, the clarifai API key was put on front end, when url is sending, anyone can see our key in console(network)
- put these sensitive data in the back end.

### step
- download clarifai in back end
- copy the key to back end
- when doing a fetch to clarifai, we send the face url and key to clarifai server.
  - so now we need that url in backend, which we can send it through another server API endpoint.
- thinking:
```
fetch('server', method...)
.then(response => response.json)
```
- At the beginning, we put url in the fetch request
- now we put it in the req.body of front end, back end receives it, and do clarifai API request
- after backend receives the results of clarifai, we: 
  - send it through ```res.json``` 
  - do entries increment


## show error message in page
- use a state to save error message, and add a component of error message that shows below the signin and register square.
- add prevent system, empty blank when signin and register, duplicate when registration, wrong password or email in signin.
- deal with the both ends seperately so that we can see if our prevent system works. 

***in catch(), a (error)=> {} arrow function is required, without it, the code will be directly execute. CALLBACK function ONLY!!***

## some missing part
- email format validation 
- trim space of string
- to lower case
- password more than certain digits
- none person picture, return no face is there

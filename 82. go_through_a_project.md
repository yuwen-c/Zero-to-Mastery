## front end
- components, layout.
- add functionality(button, input. onChange, onClick)
- connect API (face-recognition)

## routing
- a plan for signIn, signOut: where should it go? what navigation should be put on the screen?
- add a route function with page parameter to direct to that page.      
***an arrow function in child component is needed***

## server end    
***run ```npm init``` to get ```package.json```***    
***install nodemon to monitor changes and run it automatically.*** (```--save-dev``` and ```"start" : "nodemon script.js"```)    
***install express to build a server***   

- a plan. what route, what method, bear what data, in head or body, url, response?
- base on the plan, write routes.
- test them with postman
- a fake database is needed. think of a table as an array, every row of data is an object.
- think what data you need to store, in what knid of type.    
***on server end, console.log will be in terminal of server***   
```
const database = {
    users:[
        {
            id: 123,
            name: "Judy",
            email: "judy@gmail.com",
            password: "123",
            entries: 0,
            joined: new Date()
        },
        {
            id: 124,
            name: "David",
            email: "david@gmail.com",
            password: "124",
            entries: 0,
            joined: new Date()
        }
    ],
    login:[
        {
            id: 123,
            password: ""
        },
        {
            id: 124,
            password: ""
        }
    ]
}
```
## connect server end to front end     
***install cors (伺服器端存取控制) to allow to connect front end to server with HTTP***       
- run one on port 3000 and the other on 3001
- test it with ```componentDidMount``` and ```fetch``` to see if they are connected
- deal with the input information in this step, use setState to store input information 
- use certain method to connect to server, like:
```
this.grabFaceFun(response);
fetch('http://localhost:3000/image', {
  method: 'put',
  headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
  body: JSON.stringify(this.state.user)
})
```
- trigger parent setState in child component: call a parent function

## database   
***install knex to connect postgresql with server***    
***install bcrypt-nodejs, or latest version bcrypt, to encrypt password***    
- use knex syntax(SQL syntax) to re-write the server

## test it out with fromt end
- test all the buttons, input, links, routes with credentials.

***Missing part: should clear user data after sign out***
- we can assign a initial state to a variable, and every time signning out, setState.


## code review

### extract duplicate code
- sign in and register components have repeated code.
- extract it to another comopnent
***break down components so that they can be reuseable.***

### add catch properly
- ```fetch```, ```.then``` needs a ```.catch(console.log(err))``` behind.

### groupfy
- each component stays at it's own folder
- a folder calles "container" to include app.js, app.css

## re-write server-end
- create a controller folder, put each single route "handler" to it's own file.

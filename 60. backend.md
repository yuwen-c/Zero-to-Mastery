## from the very beginning...

- browser makes request to ISP(internet server provider), then to DNS(domain name server), to get the address of the website.
- browser sends request to the server of that address,   
  then the server sends data to browser.(html, css <l i n k tag>, javascript <script tag>)
- V8 engine reads the files and manipulate DOM.

## speed of http request?
- depends on:
  - how many trips
  - size of files
  - distance of server.
  
## request
- use ajax (fetch'url') and json() to change the data on the page in the real time.
  
## front end - back end

- apache server: (for basic website)
use php

- application server: (node server, for facebook, amazon)
use node.js, express.js


## actually fb and amazon do this:
- make copies to several servers located in US, Africa, Asia.
- also a load balancer to moderat the volume of users.

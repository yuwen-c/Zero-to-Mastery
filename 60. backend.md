## from the very beginning...

- browser makes request to ISP(internet server provider), then to DNS(domain name server), to get the address of the website.
- browser sends request to the server of that address,   
  then the server sends data to browser.(html, css (link tag), javascript <script tag>)
- V8 engine reads the files and manipulate DOM.

## speed of download websites?
- depends on:
  - how many trips
  - size of files
  - distance of server.
- use CDN, bundle file and min.css can help.
  
## request
- use ajax (fetch'url') and json() to change the data on the page in the real time when users are browsering.
  
## server

- has file system.(html, css...)

- apache server: (lamp stack, for basic website)
  - using php in the frontend    
  - using MySql for database

- application server: (node server, for facebook, amazon)
  - using node.js, express.js       
  - using MongoDB, postgreSql for database.

## actually fb and amazon do this:
- make copies to several servers located in US, Africa, Asia.
- also a load balancer to moderate the volume of users.
- each database maintains a copy of each other.

## what is API? (Programming Application Interface)
- is a messenger that take the request and tell the system what to do.

- is a way to communicate and share data.

- API is just like a waiter, asks you what do you need, goes to kitchen and returns with your dishes.


## examples

- Skyscannar, an aggregator website (聚合器網站).    
It doesn't have infomation of tickets itself, Skyscanner uses API of each airline company to get this information.
(such as: API of American airline)

- Also, the cable holes in the back of a TV are also API, we can get HDMI signal to our laptop.

- React also has API. We use ```React.Component``` to communicate with React package.

- We've used jsonplaceholder, and robohash, we put certain keywords(like users, posts) and random number after the url,
this is also a way to get data, it's an API.

- it can be uesd commercially, like stripe, tilio payment on website.

- we've learned window.fetch(), it's an API too.

## commercial use

- JSON and XML are used for standard format.

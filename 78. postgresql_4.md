## JOIN

### INNER JOIN

```
DATABASE SCHEMA

persons 5 rows
id (PK) INTEGER
name TEXT
age INTEGER

hobbies 10 rows
id (PK) INTEGER
person_id INTEGER
name TEXT
```
```
     // show columns in 2 tables
select persons.name, age, hobbies.name from persons JOIN hobbies ON persons.id = hobbies.person_id;
            // table1 JOIN table2 ON sth. in common
```
- JOIN ON can also be used with WHERE
```
select persons.name, hobbies.name from persons JOIN hobbies ON persons.id = hobbies.person_id where persons.name = 'Bobby McBobbyFace';
```
***INNER JOIN compares 2 tables without NULL, while OUTER JOIN does***

### OUTER JOIN
```
select customers.name, customers.email, orders.item, orders.price from customers LEFT OUTER JOIN orders on customers.id = orders.customer_id;
```
- LEFT means to keep all columns in the previous(left) table
- OUTER means to keep all results even if there is a null.
***put primary tables on the LEFT, the data can be null on the right***
***we can just change table order to substitude RIGHT JOIN***

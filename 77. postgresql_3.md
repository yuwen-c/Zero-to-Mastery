## IN

### use in as 'or'
```
DATABASE SCHEMA:

artists 12 rows
id (PK) INTEGER
name TEXT
country TEXT
genre TEXT

songs 11 rows
id (PK)INTEGER
artist TEXT
title TEXT
```
- select artists in several genre
```
select name, genre from artists WHERE genre IN ('Pop', 'Disco', 'Country');
                             // where genre = 'Pop' or genre = 'Disco'...
```
  - result
  ```
  name	genre
  Taylor Swift	Pop
  ABBA	Disco
  Celine Dion	Pop
  Garth Brooks	Country
  Shania Twain	Country
  Rihanna	Pop
  Gloria Estefan	Pop
  ```
- also, we can use NOT IN
  - to remove the data correspond to in
```
select name, genre from artists WHERE genre NOT IN ('Pop', 'Disco', 'Country');
```

### use IN in subquery
- selece Pop artists
```
select name from artists where genre = 'Pop';
```
- show songs from those pop artists
```
select title from songs WHERE artist IN (select name from artists WHERE genre = 'Pop');
```

## AS
## group by... having
```
DATABASE SCHEMA

books 15 rows
id (PK) INTEGER
author TEXT
title TEXT
words INTEGER
```
- select authors who writes more than 1000000
```
select authors, SUM(words) AS total_words from books GROUP BY author having total_words > 1000000;
```
- seselect authors who write more than an average of 150,000 words per book
```
select author, AVG(words) AS avg_words from books GROUP BY author having avg_words > 150000;
```
## Aggregation
### AVG()
### SUM()
### MAX(), MIN()
### COUNT()

- often use with group by (like above)
- Except for COUNT, aggregate functions ignore null values. 
```
SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(Bonus)  
FROM Sales.SalesPerson  
WHERE SalesQuota > 25000;
```

## Math operators also can be used
```
/* check if the heart rate is between the safy zone: 50%~90% of Max rate(220-age) */

select COUNT(*) from exercise WHERE heart_rate >= ROUND(0.5*(220-30))
                              AND heart_rate <= ROUND(0.9*(220-30))
                                              // 四捨五入
```

- can also be used in select part. (not only the WHERE part)
```
SELECT name, number_grade, ROUND(100* fraction_completed) as percent_completed from student_grades;
```

## CASE, like if/else
- case is used in a multiple "group" condition
```
SELECT name, number_grade,
    CASE
        WHEN number_grade > 90 THEN 'A'   // WHEN (condition1) THEN (type1)
        WHEN number_grade > 80 THEN 'B'
        WHEN number_grade > 70 THEN 'C'
        ELSE 'F'                          // ELSE (type4)
    END as "letter_grade"              // END AS (columnName)
FROM student_grades; 
```

- to see how many in each group, use COUNT and GROUP BY
```
SELECT COUNT(*),
    CASE
        WHEN number_grade > 90 THEN 'A'
        WHEN number_grade > 80 THEN 'B'
        WHEN number_grade > 70 THEN 'C'
        ELSE 'F'
    END as "letter_grade"
FROM student_grades
GROUP BY letter_grade;
```

## what is a program?

- a program can:
  - allocate memories.
  - parse and execute (which is simply "read and run")


## Memory heap, Call stack

- every browser has its own engine, in Chrome, V8.

- V8 engine consists of two parts:
  - MEMORY HEAP
  - CALL STACK
  
- MEMORY HEAP stories all the variables. It's limited.
  - if the unused variables occupy the space, it causes MEMORY LEAK.
  - that's why the global variable is not a good idea because we forget to clean these spaces.

- CALL STACK is where the code is being read and ran.
  - everytime V8 reads a function, puts a stack here and pops up it after running it.
  - JS runs one statement at one time. (synchronous)
  - recursion = functions that call it's self => cause Deadlocks, Stack Overflow.


## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

- JS is a single thread language that can be non-blocking. (not block a single thread)

- what if there is a huge task that take a lot of time? the next task can not be done until the end of the previous task.
=> the concept of synchronous.

> W：async = 發出要求～收到結果 這中間我可以去做其他事情
> W：你填好單子送到櫃檯，然後……
> W：他辦完再叫你的號碼→Async
> W：要站在櫃檯等他辦完→Sync
> W：因為不用站在櫃檯等，你就可以跑很多櫃檯、送很多張單子出去,

> W：所以 sync/async 是在說單一櫃檯辦事員的運作模式。
> W：然後……
> W：在對方是 async 的前提下，有些事情還是要依序辦理，

> W：那你腦內就要有個清單：
> W：等薪資戶開好，然後再去跟公司行政帳號。
> W：這個然後就是 promise 的 then
> W：再歸納一次：
> W：- sync/async 是指單一個要求or操作的運作方式。
>     （你需不需要卡住等他做完）
> W：- promise 則是用來描述多個操作之間關係的方法。
>     （可以應付 async，但也可以是 sync）
> W：以上

- in browser, there is WEB API, witch has DOM, AJAX, Timeout.

```
setTimeout(()=> {console.log("late")}, 2000);
```
- Call Stack: when it reads "setTimeout" 
  - pass it to WEB API
  - keep doing the next statement.

- WEB API
  - start a timer
  - when time's up, read the function inside of Timeout, which is CALLBACK Function, pops it to Callback Queue.
  
- CALLBACK QUEUE
  - receives the callback function.
  
- EVENT LOOP
  - keeps watching that if Call Stack is empty.
  - if empty, and there is a Callback function, then put it to the Call Stack



## when will we need Asynchronous?

- ideally we don't wait for things that take time.
  - speaking to database, 
  - make a network request,
  - image processing,
  - reading files

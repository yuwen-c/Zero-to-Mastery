## what is a program?

- a program can:
  - allocate memorys
  - parse and execute (which is simply "read and run")





## memory heap, call stack
memory leak.

deadlocks

single thread, multi threads.
synchronous, asynchronous.

JS is a single thread language that can be non-blocking

stack overflow
recursion = functions that call it's self

## Asynchronous

ideally we don't wait for things that take time.
like speaking to database, 
make a network request,
image processing,
reading files


## JS runtime environment

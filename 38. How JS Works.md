## what is a program?

- a program can:
  - allocate memories.
  - parse and execute (which is simply "read and run")


## memory heap, call stack

- every brower has its own engine, in Chrome, V8.

- V8 engine consists of two parts:
  - MEMORY HEAP
  - CALL STACK
  
- MEMORY HEAP stories all the variables. It's limited.
  - if the unused variables occupy the space, it causes MEMORY LEAK.
  - that's why the global variable is not a good idea because we forget to clean these spaces.

- CALL STACK is where the code is being read and ran.
  - everytime V8 reads a function, puts a stack here and pops up it after running it.
  - JS runs one statement at one time. (synchronous)
  - recursion = functions that call it's self => cause Deadlocks, Stack Overflow.


## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

- JS is a single thread language that can be non-blocking. (not block a single thread)

- what if there is a huge task that take a lot of time? the next task can not be done until the end of the previous task.
=> the concept of synchronous.


## JS runtime environment

- in browser, there is WEB API, witch has DOM, AJAX, Timeout.

```
setTimeout(()=> {console.log("late")}, 2000);
```
- Call Stack reads "setTimeout" 
  - pass it to WEB API
  - keep doing the next statement.

- WEB API
  - start a timer
  - when time's up, read the function inside of Timeout, which is CALLBACK Function, pops it to Callback Queue.
  
- CALLBACK QUEUE
  - receives the callback function.
  
- EVENT LOOP
  - keeps watching that if Call Stack is empty.
  - if empty, and there is a Callback function, then put it to the Call Stack






single thread, multi threads.
, asynchronous.






ideally we don't wait for things that take time.
like speaking to database, 
make a network request,
image processing,
reading files

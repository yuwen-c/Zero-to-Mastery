## reference type
```
var object1 = { value: 10};
var object2 = object1;
var object3 = { value: 10};
```
- object2 references the address of object1, while object3 create a new space.
```
object1.value = 15;
object2.value;
```
=> 15
```
object3.value;
```
=> 10.

## context

- context is the environment of the object lives, "this", the left part of "."

## extra
Conclusion: Arrow function cannot be used as an object method.
```
const objB = {
	a: function b(){
		console.log(this);
	}
}
objB.a();
```
=> {a: f}
```
const objA = {
	fun: () => { console.log(this)}
};
objA.fun();
```
=>  Window

When using an arrow function syntax in object, ```this``` is the Window.

## class

### Big words: class/ constructor function/ extends/ super
### class syntax
- parent class
- constructor is a function that makes an object.
  - it accepts some attributes
```
class Player {
	constructor(name, type){
		this.name = name;
		this.type = type;
		console.log("Player", this);******1
	}
	methodPlayer(){
		console.log(`Hi, I am ${name}`);
	}
}
```
- child class that extends parent one
```
class baseballPlayer extends Player{
	constructor(name, type){
		super(name, type);   *****3
		console.log("baseballPlayer", this); *****2
	}
	methodBaseball(){
		console.log(`I play ${this.type}`);
	}
}
```
### super
- super exists in child compomemt, and must be in the first line in constructor.
- super contains the same attributes with parent and child attributes.
- when instantiate a child component, super makes the code run through parent class to get those properties.

### instantiation
```
const baseballPlayer1 = new baseballPlayer("Jon", "snow");
const baseballPlayer2 = new baseballPlayer("Sherry", "baseball")
```

### this
***1: goes first. ```this``` is a baseballPlayer object.    
***2: goes latter. ```this``` is also an object.     
***3: when super code runs, it calls for the Player class.

- when a single parent class is being instantiated, ```this``` is an object that contains properties of parent class.
- if there are parent class and child class, when the child class is being instantiated, ```this``` in paernt class is also object that made by child class.

# how to tell a good code?
- scalable
- readable

# calculate big O
- to see if the total spending time increasing with the input size?
- when we scale up the input, how much will the function slow down

### O(n)
- linear time, for loops, while loops.

### O(1)
- constant time, never change.

### O(n^2)
- 2 nested loops

### O(a+b), O(a * b)
- if there are 2 parameters, then you'll need 2 variables, depend's its relationship, the O is a * b or a+b

== not that common:
### O(n!)
- add a loop to every input
- factorial time, the most expensive one

## simplify O:  
- just think about the worst situation, and only look at the significant impact part.



## cheat sheet
- a loop: O(n)
- 2 nested loops: O(n^2)

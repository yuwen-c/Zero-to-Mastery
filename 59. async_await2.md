### the other two new features in ES9(2018)

## finally
- finally will be executed at the end of code no matter there is an error or not.

### syntax
```
.finally(() => console.log('finally'))
```
- actually it doesn't return any value, so the parameter there is undefine.
- the parenthesis is necessary, otherwise it will execute directly, before those promises.

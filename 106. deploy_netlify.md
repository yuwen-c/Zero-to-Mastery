# netlify - deploy static website and connect to github repo

## steps:
- register netlify
- choose create site with github count
- choose repo
- deploy

## push and then automatically re-deploy
- using the same git commands.

## issue
### deploy failure
- “Treating warnings as errors because of process.env.CI = true” : https://dev.to/kapi1/solved-treating-warnings-as-errors-because-of-process-env-ci-true-bk5
- before deploy, change setting 
```
npm run build
```
to
```
CI= npm run build
```

### i18next doesn't work
- remember that we couldn't get locales files when deploying to gh-page? - the issue of path. (see 100. react-i18next)
- the same issue this time.
- we've added "homepage" to package.json for gh-page use, and set "loadpath" to i18n.js.
```
  backend: {
      // loadPath: '/dieta/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json'
      loadPath: '/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json'
  },
```
- delete the settings for gh-page ("homapage": "...url/dieta")
- delete /dieta in front of loadPath
- then works.

***test: add back the changed netlify url, still works***

# netlify - deploy static website and connect to github repo

## steps:
- register netlify
- choose create site with github count
- choose repo
- deploy

## push and then automatically re-deploy
- using the same git commands.

## issue
### deploy failure
- “Treating warnings as errors because of process.env.CI = true” : https://dev.to/kapi1/solved-treating-warnings-as-errors-because-of-process-env-ci-true-bk5
- before deploy, change setting 
```
npm run build
```
to
```
CI= npm run build
```
### if you've deployed to gh-page
- delete homepage in package.json before deploy to netlify
- which I didn't so the published website is blank and console has errors.

### i18next doesn't work
- remember that we couldn't get locales files when deploying to gh-page? - the issue of path. (see 100. react-i18next)
- the same issue this time.
- we've added "homepage" to package.json for gh-page use, and set "loadpath" to i18n.js.
```
  backend: {
      // loadPath: '/dieta/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json'
      loadPath: '/locales/{{lng}}/{{ns}}.json'
  },
```
- delete the settings for gh-page ("homapage": "...url/dieta")
- delete /dieta in front of loadPath
- then works.

***test: add back the changed netlify url, still works***

# SPA(single page app) with `react-router-dom` deploying on netlify

## issue: refreshing a deeper url, returns `404` `page not found`

## static page server
- before the spa were a thing, we store all the files with corresponding url in server
- when there is a request, server sends back the corresponding files

## spa and routing
- our code build all the routing
- so if a request with a deeper url comes directly, without asking the root route first, the browser haven't prepare those routing, so a `404` is got.
- **spa is `client-side-rendering`**
- in other case we can fix it with `server-side-rendering`, but since this is a spa, so this will not happen.

## fix the issue
- add redirect to our project to tell netlify that: always return the `index.html` file
- build a `_reidrects` file in public folder
```
// public/_redirects

/* /index.html 200

```

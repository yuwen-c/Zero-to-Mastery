## a brief comprehension, connect everything together

### Redux?
- redux, a tool to manage state of react app. 
  - originally we may have several smart components in one project, one state change may trigger another
  - redux is made for a intergral management, a complex object represented for the state is build.

### action.js
- when a change is triggered, it causes an action
- we describe the actions as functions, which include:
  - returns an object with type that describe what kind of action we have => and usually we declare them as constants in a file.
  - the returned object also bear a payload, which stands for the data that is going to pass to next function- reducer
  - what does the payload going to pass? in the searchfield case, input will receives a text, so the function's parameter is text, so is payload.

- in async cases, action doesn't return an object, instead, it returns another function.
  - a thunk middlewear is needed here (which will imported in index.js)
  - to describe the promise, we have three types, or states- pending, success, fail.
  - based on these 3 types, we have a function like: 
  - a dispatch method with type pending
  - do ```fetch```, and ```.then```, and write the returned data as payload of success
  - return error as payload of failed.
  
### reducer.js
- the describing constants are needed.
- reducers are functions that return a new state object depend on what situation we have.
- reducer function receives 2 parameters, 
  - one is state, with a default value of initialstate object
  - one is action, with a default value of empty {  }. since actions return an object.
- use switch case to list all situations (action type, the describing constants) and return a corresponding state.
- use Object.assign() method to create a new object state.
- a default case is also needed. (returns the initialState)


#### index.js
- install ```redux``` and ```react-redux```
- import ```{ createStore }``` from redux, use this method with reducer to create a store
- import ```{ Provider }``` from react-redux, use ```Provider``` to nest ```<App/>``` and sent ```store``` as props  
- install ```redux-logger```, and import ```{ createLogger }```, then new one. Use it to log out actions, an useful tool.
- install ```redux-thunk```, and import ```thunkMiddleWare``` to deal with asynchronous function
- we also need to import ```{ applyMiddleware }``` from redux to use it. so the final version of store would be:
```const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddlewear(thunkMiddleware, logger))
- if you have more then 1 reducer, then import ```{ combineReducers }```. use it to create a rootReducer
  - here we'll need the names of reducers, so import them.
  - use them with destructuring syntax: combineReducers({ reducerA, reducerB })

### App.js 
- let App know thar Redux is working => connect
- import ```{ connect }``` from react-redux
- at the bottom: export deafault ```connect(mapsStateToProps, mapsDispatchToProps)(App)```. => higher order function, means that it returns a function
  - state: let App know which state change it's going to watch
  - Dispatch: let App know which action it should follow up
- outside of App class, declare these 2 functions.
- mapsStateToProps: receives a state parameter, return a state object
```
return {
	robots: state.reducerA.propertyName,        // when you only has one reducer, then state.propertyName is enougth
	isPending: state.reducerB.propertyName      
  }
```
***no need to import reducers, I guess it's passed through index.js, we combine reducers there***

- mapsDispatchToProps: receives a dispatch parameter.
  - returns an object which the property name is function name, value is a function
  - these functions will send as props to App. the property name(function name) will be the prop name. 
```
return{
	onSearchChange: (event) => dispatch(actionA(event.target.value)) 
	onRequestRobots: () => actionB(dispatch) // OR: dispatch(actionB())  
}
```
***here we need actions to put in mapDispatchToProps, so import them***
- onSearchChange: 
  - a function that listens to the change in searchfield.
  - receives a event, and dispatch will carry the output(action) to reducer.
  - finally it replaces the onSearchChange in App class.
  
- onRequestRobots:
  - since the actionB here doesn't return an obj, instead it returns a function, so dispatch method will carry this function
  - so: ```onRequestRobots: () => dispatch(actionB())```
  - ***if we write like this, the actionB will change to const actionB = () => (dispatch) => {}***
  - or we can say, the action has the dispatch method
  - so: ```onRequestRobots: () => actionB(dispatch)```

### some changes in App.js
- no need constructor
- CALL asynchronous function in componentDidMount as: ```this.props.functionName()```  // don't forget to CALL with () 
- states that will be use in render, will destructuring to ```const { stateA, stateB } = this.props```

#### the mysterious Dispatch
- dispatch will trigger the action(the obj we've created)
- dispatch can pass action to reducer



## catch up

### destructuring of obj
```
const { searchField, robots, onSearchChange, isPending} = this.props;
// this means:
const { searchField: searchField, robots: robots} = this.props;
// which also means:
const searchField = this.props.searchField;
const robots = this.props.robots;
```

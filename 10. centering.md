## centering a button

### Why can't I centering a button with ``` margin: 0 auto```?

- button is a inline element which doesn't have a border, (actually the border is that line).

```
#content {
display: block;
margin: 0 auto;
}
```
- change the display to block then we can adjust the margin.


## centering a form

### Why can't I centering a form  with ``` margin: 0 auto```?

- it seems that the form occupy a whole row, so we cannot use margin.

```
.form-horizontal{
	margin: 0 auto;
	background-color: #FFFFFF;
	width: 500px;
}
```
- set the width. (but it changes the size of input column)

## join an project
- be invited to an project 
- if you want to invite someone, go to the repo, setting, find that person with his name.

## clone
- not fork, instead, git clone the repo to local

## open a local branch
- before doing anything, ```git pull```

- git add to staging area, git commit to local repo.

## push to remote branch
- put local branch to remote branch

```
$ git push -u origin YOURNAME_branch_layer15_20
```

- finally I ran the above command, it says:
> Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)     
> remote:      
> remote: Create a pull request for 'yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25' on GitHub by visiting:     
> remote:      https://github.com/Judy-S/GitDemo/pull/new/yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25     
> remote:      
> To https://github.com/Judy-S/GitDemo.git     
>  * [new branch]      yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25 -> yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25     
> ***Branch 'yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25' set up to track remote branch 'yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25' from 'origin'.***     
- means: my local branch now is connected with remote branch.
  - "origin" is remote
- after setting to right remote branch, ```git push```
> To https://github.com/Judy-S/GitDemo.git     
>   26db3db..0658305  yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25 -> yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25  // right action, branch -> branch

## create pull request
- create a pull request on remote repo github page
- add reviewer on the right side


## some mistakes
### want to get the newest version from local master to local branch
- I ran ```git pull```, which pull code from remote.
- also, it asks me to set upstream
> There is no tracking information for the current branch.     
> Please specify which branch you want to merge with.     
> See git-pull(1) for details.     

> ```    git pull <remote> <branch>```     

> If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:     
> ```     
>     git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25     
> ```

- so I ran
```
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25  // take <branch> out     
```
> ***Branch 'yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.***

### wrongly git push to remote master
- ```git push``` means push code from local to remote.
- I ran ```git push``` then it says:
> fatal: The upstream branch of your current branch does not match the name of your current branch.       
> To push to the upstream branch on the remote, use     

>    ```git push origin HEAD:master```     

> To push to the branch of the same name on the remote, use     

>    ```git push origin HEAD```     
> 
- I ran ```git push origin HEAD:master```, then my code in local branch directly goes to remote "local"
> To https://github.com/Judy-S/GitDemo.git     
>   ca56fd2..26db3db  HEAD -> master     // WRONG action, branch -> remote master

## roll back, user revert

### steps
- now since i wrongly push my local branch to remote master,    
I have to roll back my local master, push to remote master, to get it back to the version before I changed it.

### git log
```
$ git log
```
- use git log, to get every commit message and "head"
> commit 0658305cdde3f9d286c0cd25646066cb5bc1b27a (HEAD -> yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25, origin/yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25)

- the first seven letters are "head", will use on revert command.

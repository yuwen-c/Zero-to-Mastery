## open a local branch
- before doing anything, ```git pull```

- git add to staging area, git commit to local repo.

## push to remote branch
- put local branch to remote branch

```
$ git push -u origin YOURNAME_branch_layer15_20
```

- finally I ran the above command, it says:
> Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
> remote: 
> remote: Create a pull request for 'yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25' on GitHub by visiting:
> remote:      https://github.com/Judy-S/GitDemo/pull/new/yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25
> remote: 
> To https://github.com/Judy-S/GitDemo.git
>  * [new branch]      yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25 -> yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25
> ***Branch 'yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25' set up to track remote branch 'yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25' from 'origin'.***
- means: my local branch now is connected with remote branch.
  - "origin" is remote
- after setting to right remote branch, ```git push```
> To https://github.com/Judy-S/GitDemo.git
>   26db3db..0658305  yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25 -> yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25

## create pull request
- create a pull request on remote repo github page
- add reviewer on the right side


## some mistakes
### want to get the newest version from local master to local branch
- I ran ```git pull```, which pull code from remote.
- also, it asks me to set upstream
> There is no tracking information for the current branch.
> Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
> See git-pull(1) for details.

> ```    git pull <remote> <branch>```

> If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:
> ```
>     git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25
> ```

- so I ran
```
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25  // take <branch> out
```
> ***Branch 'yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.***

### wrongly git push to remote master
- ```git push``` means push code from local to remote.
- I ran ```git push``` then it says:
> fatal: The upstream branch of your current branch does not match the name of your current branch.  
> To push to the upstream branch on the remote, use

>    ```git push origin HEAD:master```

> To push to the branch of the same name on the remote, use

>    ```git push origin HEAD```
> 
- I ran ```git push origin HEAD:master```, then my code in local branch directly goes to remote "local"
> To https://github.com/Judy-S/GitDemo.git
>   ca56fd2..26db3db  HEAD -> master

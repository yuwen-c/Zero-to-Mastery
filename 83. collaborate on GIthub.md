## join an project
- be invited to an project 
- if you want to invite someone, go to the repo, setting, find that person with his name.

## clone
- not fork, instead, git clone the repo to local

## open a local branch
- before doing anything, ```git pull```

- git add to staging area, git commit to local repo.

## push to remote branch
- put local branch to remote branch

```
$ git push -u origin YOURNAME_branch_layer15_20
```

- finally I ran the above command, it says:
> Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)     
> remote:      
> remote: Create a pull request for 'yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25' on GitHub by visiting:     
> remote:      https://github.com/Judy-S/GitDemo/pull/new/yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25     
> remote:      
> To https://github.com/Judy-S/GitDemo.git     
>  * [new branch]      yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25 -> yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25     
> ***Branch 'yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25' set up to track remote branch 'yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25' from 'origin'.***     
- means: my local branch now is connected with remote branch.
  - "origin" is remote
- after setting to right remote branch, ```git push```
> To https://github.com/Judy-S/GitDemo.git     
>   26db3db..0658305  yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25 -> yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25  // right action, branch -> branch

## create pull request
- create a pull request on remote repo github page
- add reviewer on the right side


## MISTAKE 1 : want to get the newest version from local master to local branch

### RIGHT steps : merge    
***Actully I should have done this, right steps to get code from master to branch***
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39598875/how-to-pull-local-master-into-local-branch

- stand on the behind branch(or master) to merge changes from ahead branch 
> merge changes from local_branch TO master
> ```
> git checkout master
> git merge local_branch
> ```

> merge changes from master TO local_branch
> ```
> git checkout local_branch
> git merge master
> ```

### WRONG steps I've taken
- I ran ```git pull```, which pull code from remote.
- also, it asks me to set upstream
> There is no tracking information for the current branch.     
> Please specify which branch you want to merge with.     
> See git-pull(1) for details.     

> ```    git pull <remote> <branch>```     

> If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:     
> ```     
>     git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25     
> ```

- so I ran
```
git branch --set-upstream-to=origin yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25  // take <branch> out     
```
> ***Branch 'yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.***

## MISTAKE 2 : wrongly git push to remote master
- ```git push``` means push code from local to remote.
- I ran ```git push``` then it says:
> fatal: The upstream branch of your current branch does not match the name of your current branch.       
> To push to the upstream branch on the remote, use     

>    ```git push origin HEAD:master```     

> To push to the branch of the same name on the remote, use     

>    ```git push origin HEAD```     
> 
- I ran ```git push origin HEAD:master```, then my code in local branch directly goes to remote "local"
> To https://github.com/Judy-S/GitDemo.git     
>   ca56fd2..26db3db  HEAD -> master     // WRONG action, branch -> remote master



## ROLL BACK to the previous version
- since i wrongly push my local branch to remote master,    
I have to roll back my local master, push to remote master, to get it back to the version before I changed it.

### steps
1.  ```git revert + head number``` to roll back. (from the newest one) 
2.  when get back the previous version, push to remote master, make remote master rolls back.
3.  ```git cherry pick``` to add back the new code
4.  push it to remote branch, ask for merge or pull request


### git log
```
$ git log
```
- use git log, to get every commit message and "head"
> commit 0658305cdde3f9d286c0cd25646066cb5bc1b27a (HEAD -> yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25, origin/yuwenGithub_branch_layer21_25)

- the first seven letters are "head", will use on revert command.
- how to exit the log mode?

### git revert

#### on branch is wrong
- first of all, I did revert on branch, fatal.
> error: your local changes would be overwritten by revert.   
> hint: commit your changes or stash them to proceed.   
> fatal: revert failed   

#### should do it on master
- then I check out to master, and ```git pull``` to update it.     
(not sure if it's necessarily.     
but since I missed several steps doing local branch -> local master, I would like to make sure everything on local master is updated.)
> From https://github.com/Judy-S/GitDemo    
>   26db3db..3cbd3b7  master     -> origin/master
***what does arrow means? ->***

#### git revert commands

```
$ git revert 26db3db --no-edit
```
- ```--no-edit``` means do not edit the commit message


### cherry pick to get wanted part back
- use "no commit", then do ```git commit -m```
```
$ git cherry-pick ca56fd2 --no-commit
```
> Changes to be committed:   
>   (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)   
> 
>         modified:   Map_Solutions.txt // green   

- w/o "no commit", then do ```git add .```, ```git commit -m``` as usual.
```
$ git cherry-pick 0658305
```
> Changes not staged for commit:    
>   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)    
>   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)    
> 
>         modified:   Map_Solutions.txt  // red

> 未追蹤(Untracked files)：在版本提交後才又加進來的檔案，這些檔案並沒有被GIT所追蹤控管

> 等待提交(Changes to be committed)(GREEN)：在工作目錄(WD)的檔案執行git add後，會放在暫存區(Stage)。這些放在暫存區的檔案狀態便是等待提交囉！

### remove the tracked code if needed

- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/348170/how-do-i-undo-git-add-before-commit

- remove a certain file
```git reset <file>```
- remove all
```git reset```

### after pushing local branch to remote branch
- my inference:
since I pick a version that is total match with the suspending pull request (waiting for reviewer approvement),
there is no difference to allow me create a new pull request.

### questions:
1. merge between branch and master?
2. ```git push origin HEAD:master```  and ca56fd2..26db3db  HEAD -> master. : HEAD means??
3. set upstream, -u, commands?
4. 26db3db..3cbd3b7  master -> origin/master : what does arrow mean?

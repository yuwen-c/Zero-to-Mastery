## replace the Card with parent - CardList.

### index.js
- render component is CardList.
- and we also need a prop, so 
```
ReactDOM.render(<CardList robots={robots}/>, 
```
- robots is the prop name,
- {robots} stands for robots array.

### CardList.js
- CardList function returns the JSX syntax we wrote.
- pass the {robots} to it.
- use map() to solve the loop
- finally, return the result of map. Since it's Javascript, { }.

### key: Each child in an array should have a unique key prop,

- if a component is being deleted, the virtual DOM, React, doesn't know which component is,    
so it will re-render the entire DOM.   
By giving a uniqle key prop can solve this issue.
- when doing a loop, remember to put a key

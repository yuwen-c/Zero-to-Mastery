# why? what is the whole world-time-thing?
- get the present time of somewhere is easy, get "a certain past time" of somewhere is not.
- this article explains well - https://medium.com/@toastui/handling-time-zone-in-javascript-547e67aa842d
- factors:
  - time zones can be changed. there are countries decided to change timezone..(one has lost a whole day for that)
  - DST, daylight saving time, differs from country/ region.
- so the whole time data is saved in a big database, maintaining by developers and historians.

## moment.js

## previous issues

### inline script
- files are huge, and repeated in different pages.
- lack of CODE REUSABILITY.
- POLLUTION of global NAMESPACE, 

### script tags
- still need to copy paste tags.
- lack out DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION, some functions are needed before they have been loaded.
- still got global variable issue.

### IIFE: immediately invoked function execution
- wraps functions.
- it reduces the global variables to just one.
- still got dependency issue.
- not very readable.

```
var myApp = {};

(function(){
  myApp.add = function (a.b) {
    return a+b;
  }
})()
```

### CommonJS + Browserify, MODULE BOUNDLER
```
//js 1st file: "add.js".
module.exports = function add(a, b){
  return a+b;
}

//js 2nd
var add = require("./add")

```
- if I want a function from the 1st file, I can export it and then require the file, add it to my 2nd file.
- MODULE BOUNDLER: runs before you deploy the website, and bundle everything to a single file.
```
<script src="boundle.js"></script>
```


### ES6
- export, import
- not supported by every browser.
```
// js1
export const add = (a,b) => a+b;
// or
export default function add(){
  return a+b;
}

// js2
import { add } from = '/.add'


```

### webpack
- solves the problems!! It's where we are now!!

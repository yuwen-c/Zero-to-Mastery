## previous issues

### inline script
- files are huge, and repeated in different pages.
- lack of CODE REUSABILITY.
- POLLUTION of global NAMESPACE, 

### script tags
- still need to copy paste tags.
- lack out DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION, some functions are needed before they have been loaded.
- still got global variable issue.

### IIFE: immediately invoked function execution
- wraps functions.
- it reduces the global variables to just one.
- still got dependency issue.
- not very readable.

```
var myApp = {};

(function(){
  myApp.add = function (a.b) {
    return a+b;
  }
})()
```

### CommonJS + Browserify, module bundler



### ES6
- not supported by every browser.

## why use HOOKS?
- to replace class
- organize code well:
  - put a group of code together, instead of something in one life cycle, some in another.
- DO update everytime:
  - in order to make sure state updates everytime when component is built, or being updated, we need to write 2 life cycles: ComponentDidMount, ComponentDidUpdate, but with hooks, we don't need to do that.

## array destructuring
```
const arr = [1,2];
const [a,b] = arr;

//
a=1, b=2
```

## UseState
```
const [item, setItem] = useState([]);

// initialState of item is [].
```
- receives a parameter: the initialState of item.
- returns 2 things: the current state: item;  a function that updates state: setItem.
- setItem can be seen as a setState, put [1,2] there - setItem([1,2]), then item === [1,2]

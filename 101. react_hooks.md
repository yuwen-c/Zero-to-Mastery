## why use HOOKS?
- to replace class
- organize code well:
  - put a group of code together, instead of something in one life cycle, some in another.
- useEffect DO update everytime:
  - in order to make sure state updates everytime when component is built, or being updated, we need to write 2 life cycles: ComponentDidMount, ComponentDidUpdate, but with hooks, we don't need to do that.

## array destructuring
```
const arr = [1,2];
const [a,b] = arr;

//
a=1, b=2
```

## useState
```
const [item, setItem] = useState([]);

// initialState of item is [].
```
- receives a parameter: the initialState of item.
- returns 2 things: the current state: item;  a function that updates state: setItem.
- setItem can be seen as a setState, put [1,2] there - setItem([1,2]), then item === [1,2]

## useEffect
- think as "side effect" of function.
- Do update state everytime.
- deal with things we usually put in componentDidMount, like ```fetch```.
- can return a clean up function, or not.
- when the component gets render, run useEffect.

### 2 parameter in useEffect
- one is the function, the other is a parameter that tells useEffect: when this thing changs, call useEffect.
- so, if we put a setState in useEffect, when the component gets changes, useEffect gets called.
- in this case, we can define the second parameter that defines WHEN the useEffect gets called.
```js
useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`https://yuwengithub.github.io/dieta/activityTableData/${lng}.json`)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(result => setData(result))
}, [lng]);
``` 
- if we use setState inside and doesn't give the second parameter, then useEffect maybe will get triggered various times.
- to set the useEffect gets triggered only once after App DidMount, use ```[  ]``` as the second parameter. it's a short cut.

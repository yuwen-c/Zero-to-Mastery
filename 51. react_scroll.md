## when scrolling down, the searchBox remains on the top.

- to build a container to wrap the cardlists, kind of like a screen in the middle.

## children

- when components are nested.
- prop.children:   
  - every single component of React has this property - children
  - children has type - CardList


## inline-style

- like css inline-style, but need an object inside.   
object + javascript in JSX => double curly brackets. {{ }}

- attribute name goes like:
   - CSS: overflow-Y
   - JSX: overflowY (camelCalse)

## syntax
```
const Scroll = (prop) =>{
	return (
		<div style={{ overflowY: 'scroll', border: '5px solid black', height: '500px'}}>
			{prop.children};
		</div>
		);
}
```

# add markdown-pages folder to src
- here are we going to put our posts with markdown files
- add md files in this folder

# graphql: [___graphql](http://localhost:8000/___graphql)

- select allFiles ```command + enter```, shows edges, node
- choose absolutePath, relativePath, and run
- we can see 2 images that come with gatsby.

# connect md folder with gatsby system: ```config.js```
- in gatsby-config.js, add new plugin
- change name(just a represent name, name it freely) and path
```
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        name: `markdown`,
        path: `${__dirname}/src/markdown-pages`,
      },
    },
```
- restart the project everytime when you add new plugin
- also refresh the graphql page, run, then we can see the added files 
- we cannot yet access the actual data....one step more

# transformer-remarker
- ```$ npm install gatsby-transformer-remarker```
- add the plugin into config.js

## use it with allRemark in graphql

## index.js (indexPage)
- export that query, paste query into it
- export default (delete indexPage name in the function)
- pass props: ```{ data }``` into function
- write jsx.

- import one thing...

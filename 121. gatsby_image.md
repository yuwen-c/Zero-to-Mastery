# Deal with image in Gatsby

## in posts
- put markdown article and image in the same folder, add it directly with md syntax
```
![holaSVG](holaSVG.png)
```
- cannot modify a single image of one post, you'll modify all images in every post.

## seo, for Featured Images & Post Thumbnails when sharing the link
- use [getSrc method](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-plugin-image/#getsrc)
- only one url is passed

## static, like avatar in header.js
- use [static image](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-plugin-image/#staticimage)
- (wrong)   I used this, still works but without laveraging image processing of gatsby
```
import avatar from "../images/githubAvatar.jpg";
      <img
      src={avatar}></img>
```

## an image that will be passed in your website
- 當你的components很多層，圖片會被當成props傳進component
- use [get image](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-plugin-image/#getimage)
- gatsby will receive an array of url, send one depend on size of browser, the best one.

## deploy a React project to github

follow the official document: (GitHun Pages)
https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages

- step 0: after having all the files on github repo, we're ready to deploy.

- Step 1: Add homepage to package.json
  - change username and repo name
```
"homepage": "https://(myusername).github.io/(my-app)",
```  
- Step 2: Install gh-pages and add deploy to scripts in package.json
```
$ npm install --save gh-pages
```
```
// add 2 lines with +
"scripts": {
+   "predeploy": "npm run build",
+   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
```
- Step 3: Deploy the site by running ```npm run deploy```

- Step 4: For a project page, ensure your projectâ€™s settings use gh-pages
  - change source in setting, master -> github page
  - copy url to website blank. 
  (wait several minutes until the setting is done, then you can use the url)
  

## deploy again

- after the first deploy setting, next time when there is a change of your app, just run
```
npm run deploy
```

**** deploy effects only the gh-page, the code there will not change, you need to ```git push```
